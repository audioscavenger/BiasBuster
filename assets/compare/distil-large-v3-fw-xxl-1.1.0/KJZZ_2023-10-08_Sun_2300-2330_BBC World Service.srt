This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,420
from a woman in Gaza.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,840
The last couple of days were harrowing

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,520
and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,420
Gaza's very highly dense populated area

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,080
with each and every missile very impactful and damaging.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,540
In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies

11
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,160
at the site of a music festival,

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,320
the first site attacked by Hamas.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,420
We'll bring you the story of one family

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,380

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,980
that has been taken hostage by the Hamas military.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,820

17
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,540
Rescue efforts are continuing.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,920

This is Danielle Yawavetska with the BBC News.

20

Hello.

21

The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over 500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

22
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,070
Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel,

23
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,770
two days after they carried out their devastating mass assault.

24
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,410

29
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,610
have now been displaced with many seeking shelter in UN schools.

30
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,330
But most believe this is just the beginning.

31
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,230
Israel is massing its forces around Gaza

32
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,210
and says it has called up around 100,000.

33
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,090
100,000 army reservists.

34
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,790
Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion,

35
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,770
with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages

36
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,250
and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

37
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,070
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,790

They said power cuts were widespread

41
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,610
and were posing a major challenge for medical workers.

42
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,130
Hamas said it had fired a new barrage of missiles into Israel.

43

45
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,730
The Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean.

46
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,570
More from Barbara Pletasha in Washington.

47
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,830
The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.

48
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,110
They're sending an aircraft carrier with a debt.

49
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,630
of warplanes, accompanied by cruisers and destroyers, also extra military assistance, such as

50

munitions. In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining

51
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,750
the fight. It's backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas. There are reports that Iran

52
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,870
helped organize the unprecedented attack, although the Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the

53
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,670
U.S. hasn't seen evidence to confirm that. The UN Security Council has held an emergency

54
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,070
closed-door session to discuss the crisis.

55
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,910

begin hearings today into allegations that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians,

64
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:27,770
including children in Afghanistan. The inquiry was set up by the British government after legal action

65
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,650
was brought by two Afghan families.

00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,730
Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit

70
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,290
as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.

71
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,690
Regional elections in two of Germany's largest and wealthiest states,

72
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,950
Bavaria and Hesse, have dealt a blow to the parties

73
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,170
that form the centre-left federal government.

74
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,750
Provisional results show losses for the social,

75

largest party. The President of Ecuador has extended the state of emergency by 30 days. It's been in

77
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,730
place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando

78
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:21,050
Villavicencio. The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing

79
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,610
were found dead in prison. A horde of coins believed to have belonged to a Highland clan chief who was murdered

80
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,230
more than 300 years ago has been found in Scotland.

The archaeology team from Glasgow University

83
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,070
said this was the first major excavation in Glencoe.

84
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,270
The dig focused on scattered rocks

85
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,550
believed to have been the MacDonald Clan Chiefs Summerhouse.

88
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,290
found the horde.

89
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,190
The University of Glasgow said the discovery contained 36,

90
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,130
silver and bronze coins.

91
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,810
A number of other artefacts were also discovered at the site,

92
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,290
including a musket and fowling shot,

93
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,550

Thank you for that bulletin of news.

96
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,130
Hello, your Newsday from the BBC World Service

97
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,950
with Victoria Wohunda and Rob Young.

98
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,030
Coming up this half hour,

99
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,910
we're going to continue to focus on the conflict

100
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,850
between Israel and Gaza with voices from both sides,

101
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,630
and we'll get all your sports and business headlines.

102
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,410
We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza

103
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,130
as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.

104
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,110
The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall

105
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,470
with more than 2,000 injured.

106
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,030
The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival

107
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,570
attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.

108
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:07,850
The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.

109
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:20,390
In retaliation, Israel launched air strikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2,000 wounded, according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.

110
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,990
Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale distraction.

111
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,470
shops are closed, the streets are empty,

112
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,790
the city is said to be like a ghost town.

113
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,530
According to the United Nations,

114
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,270
123,000 Palestinians

115
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,470
have not been displaced in Gaza

116
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,830
because of the airstrikes.

117
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,270
And many Palestinians say they are now living

118
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,010
in fear of their lives.

119
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,050
In the last hour, we got this voice note

120
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,490
from a resident in Gaza.

121
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,450
The last couple of days were harrowing

122
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,250
and the airstrikes were very frequent

123
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,110
and huge.

124
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,930
Gaza is very highly.

125
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:03,350
dense populated area with very limited geographical area like with over two million people

126
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:10,770
living in in 360 kilometers square so which make it each and every missile dropped very

127
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:17,690
impactful and damaging the offensive launched from Gaza can can only be understood in the

128
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:24,870
context of the Israeli ongoing decades-long military occupation and and settler colonization

129
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:32,530
of Palestinian land and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition

130
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,750
of apartheid.

131
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:44,370
Meanwhile, Israeli also has maintained a brutal placate on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians.

132
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:54,210
Refusing population, its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive

133
00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:03,310
and trapping them in amounts to un-open-air present with restrictions on right to movement,

134
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:10,670
right to help and many other associated basic rights. Yet we were told civilians to leave,

135
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,910
I mean, leave and go where. No crossings are open, neither the sea that has also

136
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:24,190
have restriction to some point. If you trespass, you can be shot. For the last few days,

137
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:31,290
hundreds of Palestinians were killed, including women, children, elderly, and persons with disabilities.

138
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:39,730
I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school shelters that not even fully prepared

139
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,510
or equipped to accommodate these numbers and provide for their needs.

140
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:51,470
I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws in conflict and its principles.

141
00:09:51,470 --> 00:10:02,310
These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and civilians, avoid disproportionate use of force,

142
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:21,310
and have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies for the population, and now there is limited electricity and and and and and

143
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,890
crossings are fully closed to let end any supplies.

144
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,710
But in ground, all of it is happening are against these principles.

145
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:38,010
And the international community has to play a role, ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.

146
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,730
A resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like.

147
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,870
And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to BBC.com for us slash news.

There is a live page of being updated.

149
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,410
as we get more news.

150
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,870
Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy

151
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,930
for combating anti-Semitism, a former member of the Knessetat the Israeli parliament.

152
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,230
Mikhail Kotler-Vunsch.

153
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,450
Thanks so much for joining us.

154
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,850
Thank you so much for having us.

155
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,150
How are Israelis feeling today?

156
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,530
You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling

157
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,770
is it actually encourages me to ask you the question,

158
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:49,570
Because, you know, when I hear the framing of what is happening in Israel where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in Gaza alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel, 5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza.

159
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,690
each rocket a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.

160
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:06,350
When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260, at least, young partygoers on that very day of the holiday,

161
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:15,690
when I think of the anti-Semitic terror organization, Hamas, actually designated as a terror organization,

162
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:25,070
funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran holding its own civilians in Iran

163
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,970
in the same way that Gaza, in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West,

164
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:39,670
that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.

165
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,290
So I would turn the question to you, if this were happening anywhere else in the world,

166
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,110
not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians,

167
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,950
but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians,

168
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:59,590
where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians

169
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:08,090
in an holding of families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip

170
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,990
of entire families being butchered in their homes.

171
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:25,830
and to hear the way that the framing, that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.

172
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:33,770
Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives on this as we can.

173
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:41,330
I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got a sense from you of the anger there is and the sadness too.

174
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,890
anger. We are fighting for our lives.

175
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,150
There is no anger. Let it be clear.

176
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,830
You said that

177
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,970
this is like Israel's

178
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,090
9-11. Is that

179
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,950
because of the shock that this was able

180
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,950
to happen? It's not

181
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,950
just because of this shock. It's because of

182
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,650
the same modus of Perandi.

183
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,390
This is a terror

184
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,830
organization listed as such

185
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,010
in most of the countries that are listening to us

186
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,590
at the moment. Terror

187
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,670
is not a moral equivalency

188
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,910
to a sovereign country that must defend its

189
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:18,450
citizens from terror. You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand

190
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:24,570
what Israelis are feeling. There is no both sides when a terror organization ravages

191
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:32,450
civilian areas, enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians, breaking

192
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:38,390
barriers, that there is a fence. There has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.

193
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,830
And the voices that you are listening to Gaza, hasn't there of Gaza?

194
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:49,590
No, there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every day to work in Israel.

195
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,070
There are thousands of truckloads.

196
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,790
There is electricity and water still being supplied, although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza,

197
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,510
because that's who was elected to reign over Gaza.

198
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,790
And there is a responsibility of the international community and of all those that cherish life and liberty

199
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,550
to hold Hamas to account for holding those two million civilians.

200
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,750
in Gaza, hostage to their war crimes, not only on Israel, but on Gaza's civilians.

201
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,170
How do you think the Israeli military should respond then?

202
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,450
We've seen, we're told, more than 500 air strikes over the weekend.

203
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,910
How do you think the Israeli military should, how do you think any other countries are going to ask

204
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,970
questions, not answer them?

205
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,210
Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect its civilians

206
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:39,870
when they're being attacked, including as we speak, in their homes, including as we speak.

207
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,070
there is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror.

208
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,170
This is not two countries fighting each other.

209
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:52,150
A genocidal terror organization, ISIS, if you will, 9-11, needs moral clarity.

210
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,350
And this is not just about Jews around the world who are now under attack.

211
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,870
To my question, how do you think the military should respond?

212
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,170
There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza,

213
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:09,790
although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment.

214
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,010
Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government to go?

215
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:20,750
There are dozens of Israeli hostages, and many of them are civilians that were abducted,

216
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:26,130
many of them raped, many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated.

217
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:33,030
And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must,

218
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,770
the citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak.

219
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:49,490
and every country that cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught massacre of its civilians

220
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,930
and those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization

221
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,210
and I want to make it very clear alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers

222
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,010
and two civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization

223
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,410
in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.

224
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:13,270
And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries must call for the immediate and unconditional return

225
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:19,950
because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization,

226
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,510
to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.

227
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,630
And what the IDF will have to do and the state of Israel will have to do in its existential war

228
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,390
is not just about the state of Israel.

229
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,370
I want to make it very clear to your listeners.

230
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,670
Mikhail Kalkla, Vunch, we've got to leave it there.

231
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,570
Thanks for joining us.

232
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,270
Well, staying with this story and looking at the business side of things.

233
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,970
One industry that's already feeling the impact of this conflict is the aviation industry

234
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,290
with dozens of flights already cancelled.

235
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,050
Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore.

236
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:52,930
Ketis Silva.

237
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,490
Keti, what are we seeing?

238
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,850
Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines cancelling flights,

239
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,510
the likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair,

240
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,870
all cancelled journeys.

241
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,310
British Airways, for its part, told the BBC

242
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,230
that it's only cancelled one flight on Sunday

243
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,750
and that it's going to be adjusting departure times

244
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,010
for flights in the coming days.

245
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,090
And that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport

246
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,250
or if perhaps they want to land at different times of the day

247
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,510
that may be deemed safer.

248
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,890
Many of these airlines are also offering passengers

249
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,310
to cancel their flights or to move the dates

250
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,550
with no sort of change fees.

251
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,770
Flights to Israel's second international airport,

252
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:37,050
Eliat, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea. They've been unaffected. But we've also heard

253
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,670
that Israelis flag carrier El Al. It's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to

254
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:47,570
Tel Aviv for now, but again allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.

255
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,870
But get to this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying or desperately trying

256
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:58,890
to leave. Oh, to leave as well as to get home. So that's one of the major issues is that

257
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,730
many have found themselves stranded and with fears about whether or not the airspace will be closed.

258
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:12,590
So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there amongst them stranded in Cyprus at Lanika International Airport late last night.

259
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,570
Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights home.

260
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,970
As I say, rumours about whether or not the country may close its airspace.

261
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,990
It was hard to get tickets, we understand.

262
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,110
Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights.

263
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,130
and getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.

264
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,250
In terms of leaving the country, I've heard, for example, as well, from Athens,

265
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:40,730
the foreign ministry is saying that it's working to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.

266
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,650
Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece.

267
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:49,670
But there is indeed much concern about many of the foreign workers in Israel.

268
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,350
I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel,

269
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,670
and so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home

270
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,050
if indeed they want to leave Israel.

271
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,850
All right, Katie, Silver, always a pleasure to have you on the program,

272
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,310
our business correspondent there in Singapore.

273
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,930
And we are remaining with this story,

274
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,990
and we are now going to speak to our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.

275
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,290
Good morning to you, Jeremy.

276
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,470
Now, you have called this a major Middle East crisis.

277
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,790
Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?

278
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:26,290
Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group, Hamas,

279
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,910
has been able to break out of Gaza, which is surrounded by, if you like,

280
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,310
a ring of steel of fences, wire fences and concrete,

281
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:42,730
break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis, including many, many civilians.

282
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,510
That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before,

283
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,190
and it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma

284
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,270
and plenty of people here compare it to the not.

285
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,690
9-11 attacks in the United States.

286
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,850
There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that if you adjust the death toll

287
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:09,650
for population, it's the equivalent of the Americans losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.

288
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:18,210
So it's a big, big event, and the Israeli response, which is going to be is already very heavy

289
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,630
military action, but they'll be a land invasion too of Gaza.

290
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:28,370
now that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region

291
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,250
so we're into really unexplored territory right now

292
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,650
and Jeremy you have been in the region you have been in the area

293
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:41,250
just for our listeners benefit can you describe what Gaza strip looks like

294
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,690
and how that area is to Israel

295
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,330
Gaza is a narrow strip of land

296
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,030
along the Mediterranean coast

297
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,890
which is surrounded mostly by Israel,

298
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,590
but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.

299
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:08,890
The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.

300
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:16,970
Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948,

301
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,670
a time that the Palestinians called the Nakpa, the catastrophe.

302
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:28,770
And it's an area where people are mostly very poor, they live in very difficult and cramped conditions,

303
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,770
they're mostly not allowed to leave the area.

304
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,750
There are plenty of adults there who've never left.

305
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:44,130
And so it's some, it is a situation which is life there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic.

306
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:49,930
And since 2007, it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group, Hamas,

307
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,690
which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic resistance movement.

308
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,910
And you wrote a nice read on our website

309
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,790
where you said that, you know, Hamas blindsided Israel

310
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,330
with what you call most serious attack in a generation.

311
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,770
And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken,

312
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,950
including civilians as well as soldiers.

313
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,610
What sort of challenge does this pose

314
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,830
for the government of Mr. Netanyahu and the army going forward?

315
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,610
It's the most profound challenge

316
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:25,730
that any Israel government has, I think, faced probably for 50 years since the 1973 Middle East War.

317
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:35,970
His political enemies are already blaming him, saying that he took his eye off the ball for a variety of reasons.

318
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,010
It's clear that there's been, from the Israeli perspective, a huge intelligence failure,

319
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,350
and they're struggling militarily to assert themselves.

320
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,290
They will succeed in doing that.

321
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,570
I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.

322
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:59,350
I think the big question, which was, and this is probably an equal challenge for the Israelis,

323
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,910
is what happens after that?

324
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,430
How do they, what happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?

325
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,890
Because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza and finally pulled out in 2005,

326
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,130
do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation,

327
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,670
but if they send in their troops,

328
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,350
there's going to have to be some kind of governance of a territory,

329
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,990
which is maybe small,

330
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:26,850
but as I said,

331
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,650
contains getting on for two and a half million people.

332
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,010
Jeremy Bowen there,

333
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,410
thank you for coming on to the programme.

334
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,170
He is our international editor.

335
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,790
We're going to move away from our top story.

336
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,670
We will return to it later on on the program, though.

337
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,190
Shannon is here. He's going to give us some sports headlines.

338
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,050
Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goes, but they

339
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,230
finally beat Manchester City in the

340
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,490
Premier League. Gabriel Martinelli, scoring the only goal

341
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,150
in the 86 minute as City lost

342
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,530
their second game in the Premier League

343
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,450
in Aerova. First time that's happened

344
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,450
in five years. European

345
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,430
football's governing body, UEFA, has postponed

346
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,550
all matches scheduled in Israel

347
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,150
during the next fortnight amid

348
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,390
increased tensions in the region. Israel

349
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,390
were due to play Switzerland in a

350
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,710
Euro-2020 qualifier in Tel Aviv.

351
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,190
But that game has been

352
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,650
rescheduled and UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days to see whether

353
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:27,330
Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo will still take place on the 15th of October.

354
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:33,550
To athletics news next, Kenyan Kelvin Kipton shattered the men's marathon world record in Chicago.

355
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:40,110
He beat Elliot, his compatrii, Eli Kipchoga's previous mark by more than 30 seconds and 23-year-old

356
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,130
finished in a time of two hours, 35 seconds.

357
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,130
And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup, despite Fiji, losing.

358
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,070
2423 to Portugal

359
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,070
in the final pool stage match.

360
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,770
Fiji got a losing bonus point

361
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,150
and they qualify at Australia's expense

362
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,550
due to their 22-15 victory

363
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,210
way back in September.

364
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,090
Isaac, thank you very much indeed.

365
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,530
Now we are going to turn

366
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,770
to Afghanistan because thousands of people

367
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,430
in the west of the country

368
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,930
are spending a second night in the open

369
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,050
after a strong earthquake on Saturday

370
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,210
reduced entire villages to rubble.

371
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,170
There's been confusion about the number

372
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:23,230
of dead with Taliban officials apologizing for an early assessment that more than 2,000 people

373
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:29,150
had died. The United Nations Humanitarian Agency says that more than 1,000 have been killed

374
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:35,290
and more than 500 are still missing. I'm now joined by my colleague from the Afghan service,

375
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,510
Angela. Good morning to you, Angela. What is the latest that you can tell us about this

376
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:47,030
devastating event? Good morning. The news, I'm

377
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:54,410
receiving from Afghanistan is, actually I can say that is a very, very, very big.

378
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,530
The darkest time that we are experiencing in Afghanistan,

379
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:12,210
the number that the Taliban are trying to share with the media is very different

380
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,030
what we have receiving from the people.

381
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:30,990
In that area, we had more than 20 violence which are completely destroyed in the earthquake.

382
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:39,130
And also, there is no way for the – actually, in the first hall where Sullivan tried to control the medias,

383
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:45,410
we didn't receive – actually, we thought that everything is not that bad.

384
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:59,710
bad when we sent the volunteers group to the area and actually I'm so sorry I'm in very no no

385
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:04,710
no no and so Angela basically the the the Taliban have gone back to what they said the numbers

386
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,250
have changed but what are people saying on the ground those who've been affected

387
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,390
they don't accept the numbers which the Taliban

388
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:25,070
is shedding. Actually, and also, I think more than 2,000 people are killed. A thousand people

389
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:36,770
displaced and thousand people are missing in this crisis. And we have nothing. At that moment,

390
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:45,390
at this moment, there are no big, big offer or support from the Taliban for the people.

391
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:56,670
just the red grass and MSF provided some help for the people and the volunteers group from

392
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,290
Angela.

393
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:05,830
Thank you so much for coming on to the program, telling us about the devastating earthquake that has shaken Afghanistan in the west of the country.
