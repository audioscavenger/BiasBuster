357610	359130	silver and bronze coins.
359570	362810	A number of other artefacts were also discovered at the site,

369450	370450	BBC News
374010	375510	Thank you for that bulletin of news.
375950	378130	Hello, your Newsday from the BBC World Service
378130	379950	with Victoria Wohunda and Rob Young.
380070	381030	Coming up this half hour,
381090	382910	we're going to continue to focus on the conflict
382910	386850	between Israel and Gaza with voices from both sides,
386970	389630	and we'll get all your sports and business headlines.
394150	398410	We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza
398410	402130	as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.
402290	407110	The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall
407110	409470	with more than 2,000 injured.
409510	415030	The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival
415030	419570	attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.
419650	427850	The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.
428130	440390	In retaliation, Israel launched air strikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2,000 wounded, according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.
440810	444990	Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale distraction.
444990	447470	shops are closed, the streets are empty,
447710	450790	the city is said to be like a ghost town.
451010	452530	According to the United Nations,
453450	455270	123,000 Palestinians
455270	457470	have not been displaced in Gaza
457470	458830	because of the airstrikes.
458930	461270	And many Palestinians say they are now living
461270	463010	in fear of their lives.
463070	465050	In the last hour, we got this voice note
465050	466490	from a resident in Gaza.
467050	469450	The last couple of days were harrowing
469450	472250	and the airstrikes were very frequent
472250	473110	and huge.
473610	474930	Gaza is very highly.
474990	483350	dense populated area with very limited geographical area like with over two million people
483350	490770	living in in 360 kilometers square so which make it each and every missile dropped very
490770	497690	impactful and damaging the offensive launched from Gaza can can only be understood in the
497690	504870	context of the Israeli ongoing decades-long military occupation and and settler colonization
504990	512530	of Palestinian land and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition
512530	513750	of apartheid.
514710	524370	Meanwhile, Israeli also has maintained a brutal placate on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians.
526750	534210	Refusing population, its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive
534210	543310	and trapping them in amounts to un-open-air present with restrictions on right to movement,
543590	550670	right to help and many other associated basic rights. Yet we were told civilians to leave,
550850	557910	I mean, leave and go where. No crossings are open, neither the sea that has also
557910	564190	have restriction to some point. If you trespass, you can be shot. For the last few days,
564190	571290	hundreds of Palestinians were killed, including women, children, elderly, and persons with disabilities.
571510	579730	I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school shelters that not even fully prepared
579730	584510	or equipped to accommodate these numbers and provide for their needs.
585530	591470	I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws in conflict and its principles.
591470	602310	These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and civilians, avoid disproportionate use of force,
604310	621310	and have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies for the population, and now there is limited electricity and and and and and
621470	625890	crossings are fully closed to let end any supplies.
626770	630710	But in ground, all of it is happening are against these principles.
631490	638010	And the international community has to play a role, ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.
638890	643730	A resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like.
643730	648870	And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to BBC.com for us slash news.
648870	651290	There is a live page of being updated.
651470	652410	as we get more news.
652850	656870	Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy
656870	661930	for combating anti-Semitism, a former member of the Knessetat the Israeli parliament.
662130	663230	Mikhail Kotler-Vunsch.
663350	664450	Thanks so much for joining us.
665690	666850	Thank you so much for having us.
666870	669150	How are Israelis feeling today?
670450	676530	You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling
676530	680770	is it actually encourages me to ask you the question,
680770	709570	Because, you know, when I hear the framing of what is happening in Israel where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in Gaza alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel, 5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza.
709570	714690	each rocket a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.
715030	726350	When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260, at least, young partygoers on that very day of the holiday,
726770	735690	when I think of the anti-Semitic terror organization, Hamas, actually designated as a terror organization,
735690	745070	funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran holding its own civilians in Iran
745070	751970	in the same way that Gaza, in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West,
752510	759670	that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.
759790	764290	So I would turn the question to you, if this were happening anywhere else in the world,
764290	768110	not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians,
768530	771950	but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians,
772310	779590	where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians
779590	788090	in an holding of families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip
788090	791990	of entire families being butchered in their homes.
791990	805830	and to hear the way that the framing, that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.
805890	813770	Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives on this as we can.
813830	821330	I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got a sense from you of the anger there is and the sadness too.
821990	823890	anger. We are fighting for our lives.
824110	826150	There is no anger. Let it be clear.
826930	827830	You said that
827830	829970	this is like Israel's
829970	832090	9-11. Is that
832090	833950	because of the shock that this was able
833950	835950	to happen? It's not
835950	837950	just because of this shock. It's because of
837950	839650	the same modus of Perandi.
839950	841390	This is a terror
841390	843830	organization listed as such
843830	846010	in most of the countries that are listening to us
846010	847590	at the moment. Terror
847590	849670	is not a moral equivalency
849670	851910	to a sovereign country that must defend its
851990	858450	citizens from terror. You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand
858450	864570	what Israelis are feeling. There is no both sides when a terror organization ravages
864570	872450	civilian areas, enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians, breaking
872450	878390	barriers, that there is a fence. There has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.
879210	881830	And the voices that you are listening to Gaza, hasn't there of Gaza?
881990	889590	No, there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every day to work in Israel.
889770	892070	There are thousands of truckloads.
892370	898790	There is electricity and water still being supplied, although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza,
898850	902510	because that's who was elected to reign over Gaza.
902850	907790	And there is a responsibility of the international community and of all those that cherish life and liberty
907790	911550	to hold Hamas to account for holding those two million civilians.
911990	917750	in Gaza, hostage to their war crimes, not only on Israel, but on Gaza's civilians.
918010	920170	How do you think the Israeli military should respond then?
920270	925450	We've seen, we're told, more than 500 air strikes over the weekend.
925470	928910	How do you think the Israeli military should, how do you think any other countries are going to ask
928910	929970	questions, not answer them?
930510	934210	Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect its civilians
934210	939870	when they're being attacked, including as we speak, in their homes, including as we speak.
939870	943070	there is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror.
943670	946170	This is not two countries fighting each other.
946490	952150	A genocidal terror organization, ISIS, if you will, 9-11, needs moral clarity.
952550	956350	And this is not just about Jews around the world who are now under attack.
956370	958870	To my question, how do you think the military should respond?
958990	963170	There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza,
963430	969790	although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment.
969870	974010	Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government to go?
974570	980750	There are dozens of Israeli hostages, and many of them are civilians that were abducted,
980910	986130	many of them raped, many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated.
986670	993030	And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must,
993410	996770	the citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak.
996770	1009490	and every country that cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught massacre of its civilians
1009490	1013930	and those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization
1013930	1018210	and I want to make it very clear alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers
1018210	1022010	and two civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization
1022010	1026410	in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.
1026770	1033270	And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries must call for the immediate and unconditional return
1033270	1039950	because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization,
1040430	1043510	to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.
1043630	1048630	And what the IDF will have to do and the state of Israel will have to do in its existential war
1048630	1050390	is not just about the state of Israel.
1050530	1052370	I want to make it very clear to your listeners.
1052510	1054670	Mikhail Kalkla, Vunch, we've got to leave it there.
1054770	1055570	Thanks for joining us.
1055570	1060270	Well, staying with this story and looking at the business side of things.
1060470	1065970	One industry that's already feeling the impact of this conflict is the aviation industry
1065970	1068290	with dozens of flights already cancelled.
1068470	1072050	Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore.
1072270	1072930	Ketis Silva.
1073190	1074490	Keti, what are we seeing?
1075510	1078850	Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines cancelling flights,
1079070	1083510	the likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair,
1083510	1084870	all cancelled journeys.
1085310	1087310	British Airways, for its part, told the BBC
1087310	1090230	that it's only cancelled one flight on Sunday
1090230	1092750	and that it's going to be adjusting departure times
1092750	1094010	for flights in the coming days.
1094050	1097090	And that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport
1097090	1100250	or if perhaps they want to land at different times of the day
1100250	1101510	that may be deemed safer.
1101830	1104890	Many of these airlines are also offering passengers
1104890	1107310	to cancel their flights or to move the dates
1107310	1109550	with no sort of change fees.
1110310	1112770	Flights to Israel's second international airport,
1112770	1117050	Eliat, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea. They've been unaffected. But we've also heard
1117050	1121670	that Israelis flag carrier El Al. It's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to
1121670	1127570	Tel Aviv for now, but again allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.
1127910	1132870	But get to this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying or desperately trying
1132870	1138890	to leave. Oh, to leave as well as to get home. So that's one of the major issues is that
1138890	1145730	many have found themselves stranded and with fears about whether or not the airspace will be closed.
1145890	1152590	So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there amongst them stranded in Cyprus at Lanika International Airport late last night.
1153350	1157570	Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights home.
1157890	1161970	As I say, rumours about whether or not the country may close its airspace.
1162070	1163990	It was hard to get tickets, we understand.
1164090	1168110	Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights.
1168110	1171130	and getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.
1171450	1175250	In terms of leaving the country, I've heard, for example, as well, from Athens,
1175430	1180730	the foreign ministry is saying that it's working to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.
1181190	1184650	Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece.
1184770	1189670	But there is indeed much concern about many of the foreign workers in Israel.
1189830	1193350	I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel,
1193550	1196670	and so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home
1196670	1198050	if indeed they want to leave Israel.
1198590	1201850	All right, Katie, Silver, always a pleasure to have you on the program,
1202110	1204310	our business correspondent there in Singapore.
1204810	1206930	And we are remaining with this story,
1207030	1210990	and we are now going to speak to our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
1211110	1212290	Good morning to you, Jeremy.
1212490	1216470	Now, you have called this a major Middle East crisis.
1216770	1218790	Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?
1219790	1226290	Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group, Hamas,
1226290	1231910	has been able to break out of Gaza, which is surrounded by, if you like,
1232090	1235310	a ring of steel of fences, wire fences and concrete,
1235950	1242730	break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis, including many, many civilians.
1243050	1247510	That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before,
1247770	1253190	and it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma
1253190	1256270	and plenty of people here compare it to the not.
1256290	1258690	9-11 attacks in the United States.
1259190	1263850	There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that if you adjust the death toll
1263850	1269650	for population, it's the equivalent of the Americans losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.
1269830	1278210	So it's a big, big event, and the Israeli response, which is going to be is already very heavy
1278210	1282630	military action, but they'll be a land invasion too of Gaza.
1282630	1288370	now that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region
1288370	1292250	so we're into really unexplored territory right now
1292850	1296650	and Jeremy you have been in the region you have been in the area
1296650	1301250	just for our listeners benefit can you describe what Gaza strip looks like
1301250	1303690	and how that area is to Israel
1305990	1309330	Gaza is a narrow strip of land
1309330	1312030	along the Mediterranean coast
1312030	1314890	which is surrounded mostly by Israel,
1316650	1321590	but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.
1323510	1328890	The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.
1329270	1336970	Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948,
1337250	1340670	a time that the Palestinians called the Nakpa, the catastrophe.
1342030	1348770	And it's an area where people are mostly very poor, they live in very difficult and cramped conditions,
1349270	1351770	they're mostly not allowed to leave the area.
1352230	1355750	There are plenty of adults there who've never left.
1356630	1364130	And so it's some, it is a situation which is life there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic.
1364310	1369930	And since 2007, it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group, Hamas,
1369930	1373690	which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic resistance movement.
1374010	1377910	And you wrote a nice read on our website
1377910	1380790	where you said that, you know, Hamas blindsided Israel
1380790	1384330	with what you call most serious attack in a generation.
1384610	1387770	And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken,
1387970	1389950	including civilians as well as soldiers.
1390510	1392610	What sort of challenge does this pose
1392610	1395830	for the government of Mr. Netanyahu and the army going forward?
1396790	1398610	It's the most profound challenge
1398610	1405730	that any Israel government has, I think, faced probably for 50 years since the 1973 Middle East War.
1408330	1415970	His political enemies are already blaming him, saying that he took his eye off the ball for a variety of reasons.
1416570	1421010	It's clear that there's been, from the Israeli perspective, a huge intelligence failure,
1421850	1424350	and they're struggling militarily to assert themselves.
1424350	1426290	They will succeed in doing that.
1426290	1430570	I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.
1431370	1439350	I think the big question, which was, and this is probably an equal challenge for the Israelis,
1440170	1441910	is what happens after that?
1442430	1447430	How do they, what happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?
1447610	1453890	Because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza and finally pulled out in 2005,
1455430	1458130	do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation,
1458390	1459670	but if they send in their troops,
1460590	1464350	there's going to have to be some kind of governance of a territory,
1464570	1465990	which is maybe small,
1466170	1466850	but as I said,
1468310	1470650	contains getting on for two and a half million people.
1472050	1473010	Jeremy Bowen there,
1473150	1474410	thank you for coming on to the programme.
1474530	1476170	He is our international editor.
1483210	1484790	We're going to move away from our top story.
1484930	1486670	We will return to it later on on the program, though.
1487370	1489190	Shannon is here. He's going to give us some sports headlines.
1489330	1491050	Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goes, but they
1491050	1493230	finally beat Manchester City in the
1493230	1495490	Premier League. Gabriel Martinelli, scoring the only goal
1495490	1497150	in the 86 minute as City lost
1497150	1499530	their second game in the Premier League
1499530	1501450	in Aerova. First time that's happened
1501450	1503450	in five years. European
1503450	1505430	football's governing body, UEFA, has postponed
1505430	1507550	all matches scheduled in Israel
1507550	1509150	during the next fortnight amid
1509150	1511390	increased tensions in the region. Israel
1511390	1513390	were due to play Switzerland in a
1513390	1515710	Euro-2020 qualifier in Tel Aviv.
1515990	1517190	But that game has been
1517190	1521650	rescheduled and UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days to see whether
1521650	1527330	Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo will still take place on the 15th of October.
1527770	1533550	To athletics news next, Kenyan Kelvin Kipton shattered the men's marathon world record in Chicago.
1533790	1540110	He beat Elliot, his compatrii, Eli Kipchoga's previous mark by more than 30 seconds and 23-year-old
1540110	1543130	finished in a time of two hours, 35 seconds.
1543350	1547130	And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup, despite Fiji, losing.
1547190	1549070	2423 to Portugal
1549070	1551070	in the final pool stage match.
1551190	1552770	Fiji got a losing bonus point
1552770	1555150	and they qualify at Australia's expense
1555150	1557550	due to their 22-15 victory
1557550	1559210	way back in September.
1559650	1561090	Isaac, thank you very much indeed.
1561670	1563530	Now we are going to turn
1563530	1566770	to Afghanistan because thousands of people
1566770	1568430	in the west of the country
1568430	1570930	are spending a second night in the open
1570930	1573050	after a strong earthquake on Saturday
1573050	1575210	reduced entire villages to rubble.
1575210	1577170	There's been confusion about the number
1577190	1583230	of dead with Taliban officials apologizing for an early assessment that more than 2,000 people
1583230	1589150	had died. The United Nations Humanitarian Agency says that more than 1,000 have been killed
1589150	1595290	and more than 500 are still missing. I'm now joined by my colleague from the Afghan service,
1595470	1600510	Angela. Good morning to you, Angela. What is the latest that you can tell us about this
1600510	1607030	devastating event? Good morning. The news, I'm
1607190	1614410	receiving from Afghanistan is, actually I can say that is a very, very, very big.
1619130	1624530	The darkest time that we are experiencing in Afghanistan,
1624910	1632210	the number that the Taliban are trying to share with the media is very different
1632210	1636030	what we have receiving from the people.
1637370	1650990	In that area, we had more than 20 violence which are completely destroyed in the earthquake.
1651670	1659130	And also, there is no way for the – actually, in the first hall where Sullivan tried to control the medias,
1659610	1665410	we didn't receive – actually, we thought that everything is not that bad.
1667410	1679710	bad when we sent the volunteers group to the area and actually I'm so sorry I'm in very no no
1679710	1684710	no no and so Angela basically the the the Taliban have gone back to what they said the numbers
1684710	1689250	have changed but what are people saying on the ground those who've been affected
1690790	1695390	they don't accept the numbers which the Taliban
1695410	1705070	is shedding. Actually, and also, I think more than 2,000 people are killed. A thousand people
1705070	1716770	displaced and thousand people are missing in this crisis. And we have nothing. At that moment,
1717330	1725390	at this moment, there are no big, big offer or support from the Taliban for the people.
1725410	1736670	just the red grass and MSF provided some help for the people and the volunteers group from
1736670	1737290	Angela.
1738490	1745830	Thank you so much for coming on to the program, telling us about the devastating earthquake that has shaken Afghanistan in the west of the country.
