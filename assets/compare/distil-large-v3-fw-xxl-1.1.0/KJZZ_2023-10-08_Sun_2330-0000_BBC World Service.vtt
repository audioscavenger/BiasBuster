00:14.800 --> 00:20.280
Hello and welcome to Newsday from the BBC World Service with Rob Young and Victoria Oonghunda.

00:20.440 --> 00:25.720
Israel is responding to Hamas' surprise attacks at the weekend with a series of airstrikes in Gaza.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.220
Palestinian health officials say more than 400 people have been killed.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.640
Israel says that more than 700 of its citizens have died in their attacks so far.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.460
We get the latest from both sides.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.220
The first is summary of the latest world news.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.600
BBC News with Emily Thomas.

00:46.560 --> 00:52.640
Israeli military has said its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over 500 targets

00:52.640 --> 00:58.580
overnight in the Gaza Strip. Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants

00:58.580 --> 01:04.560
in several locations inside Israel two days after they carried out a devastating mass assault.

01:04.800 --> 01:11.440
More than 700 Israelis have been killed. Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians

01:11.440 --> 01:14.880
have been killed by Israeli air strikes before the latest barrage.

01:15.960 --> 01:20.700
Hamas said it had fired missiles targeting Ben-Gurian airport near Tel Aviv.

01:21.320 --> 01:27.460
Three U.S. air carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended services to Tel Aviv,

01:27.960 --> 01:31.020
but some evacuation flights have taken place from the airport.

01:31.340 --> 01:37.380
The UN Security Council has held an emergency meeting in New York to discuss the crisis behind closed doors.

01:37.700 --> 01:42.740
The UN Middle East envoy called on all countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.

01:43.860 --> 01:49.900
In other news, an independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into allegations

01:49.900 --> 01:56.660
that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2013.

01:57.090 --> 02:01.480
The inquiry was set up after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.

02:02.360 --> 02:08.160
The US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to China,

02:08.620 --> 02:10.360
has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.840
Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit

02:13.840 --> 02:17.320
as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.

02:17.620 --> 02:20.320
Mr. Wong said he hoped the visit would help the US

02:20.320 --> 02:23.640
to view its relationship with China in a more objective way.

02:24.740 --> 02:28.800
In Ecuador, the state of emergency has been extended by 30 days.

02:29.020 --> 02:31.380
It's been in place since the assassination in August

02:31.380 --> 02:35.160
of the anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio.

02:35.440 --> 02:39.200
The extension comes to days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing

02:39.200 --> 02:40.780
were found dead in prison.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.120
BBC News.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.500
Emily, thank you for that news summary.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.900
Hello and welcome to Newsday.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.120
We will be focusing this half hour

02:52.120 --> 02:53.660
on the latest development

02:53.660 --> 02:55.480
inside Gaza and Israel

02:55.480 --> 02:57.140
and hear from a aid organization

02:57.140 --> 02:58.720
as to what can be done

02:58.720 --> 03:00.540
to avoid more civilian deaths.

03:00.740 --> 03:03.620
And we also have a full bulletin

03:03.620 --> 03:05.440
of sports who do stay with us.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.780
It's me, Vic and Rob

03:06.780 --> 03:08.280
and Isaac Fennon later on.

03:12.600 --> 03:18.000
Well, we start this half hour of the program with the latest developments in Gaza and Israel.

03:18.220 --> 03:22.540
It is now two days since Hamas militants launched a wave of attacks against Israel.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.580
Hamas runs Gaza where more than two million Palestinians live,

03:26.780 --> 03:31.040
and Hamas is also designated as a terror group by much of the Western world.

03:31.780 --> 03:33.820
The death toll continues to rise.

03:34.060 --> 03:37.520
700 Israelis have been killed and over 2,000 injured.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.380
In retaliation, Israel has launched airstrikes on the Gaza Strip,

03:41.380 --> 03:44.820
which have killed at least 413 people.

03:45.380 --> 03:47.660
And battles are continuing inside Israel

03:47.660 --> 03:51.240
between the Israeli Defence Forces and Hamas fighters.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.620
For the latest, I've been talking to a spokesperson

03:53.620 --> 03:57.020
for the Israeli Defence Forces, Masha Mikkelson,

03:57.160 --> 04:00.840
and I asked if there are still fighters in Israel at the moment.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.540
Yes, there are.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.660
There's fighting still going on in several points

04:05.660 --> 04:07.780
in the community surrounding the Gaza Strip.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.180
We're talking about Berri, Reim,

04:11.380 --> 04:18.060
Kfar Aza, the Zikkim military base, there's ongoing combat, and it's a thing that takes

04:18.060 --> 04:24.840
hours, multiple hours, to clear those terrorists out, and the idea of is focusing right now

04:24.840 --> 04:30.240
on getting the southern part of Israel back to normal without terrorists on Israeli soil.

04:30.340 --> 04:32.480
How long do you think it will take to get it back to normal?

04:33.420 --> 04:39.460
It's hard to say. We hoped we would be in a better situation by the end of yesterday,

04:39.460 --> 04:41.540
but they're still fighting going on.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.040
This is our main objective throughout the day

04:44.040 --> 04:45.820
to save as many lives as possible

04:45.820 --> 04:49.100
and get the terrorists out of Israel,

04:49.720 --> 04:50.600
whatever it takes.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.740
While we're doing that,

04:52.880 --> 04:55.620
IDF aircrafts are striking in Gaza,

04:56.020 --> 04:58.620
hundreds of military Hamas terrorist targets.

05:01.120 --> 05:06.680
We have seen around 880 targets

05:06.680 --> 05:09.740
that have been struck, including terror tunnels.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.820
That's, of course, in response to over 3,300 rockets

05:14.820 --> 05:18.400
that were fired from the Gaza Strip in addition to the invasion.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.120
I'm going to come back to the airstrikes in just a moment.

05:21.580 --> 05:25.180
Do you know whether there are still Hamas fighters entering Israel,

05:25.440 --> 05:29.220
or is that boundary between Israel and the Gaza Strip secure?

05:31.500 --> 05:36.660
There are Hamas people trying to infiltrate Israel, yes, still as we speak,

05:36.680 --> 05:41.560
They were being met with fire from IDF UAVs that are surveilling the area of the border.

05:42.240 --> 05:48.380
When they entered two days ago in the morning, they blew up significant part of the fence.

05:48.380 --> 05:53.540
So there are still breached points of the fence that we are securing through the year.

05:53.980 --> 05:59.560
Do you know how many people have been abducted and taken from Israel to Gaza?

06:00.500 --> 06:03.300
We don't have the exact numbers, but it's in the dozens.

06:03.640 --> 06:03.920
Right.

06:03.920 --> 06:30.180
Right. We spoke to one family an hour ago on this program. They think that five members of their family, including an eight-year-old girl, have been taken. And they contacted us because they were worried that the authorities were not doing all they could to try to secure their return. If you don't know exactly how many people have been taken, do you have any idea where these people are? And what are you intending to do to try to secure their release?

06:30.180 --> 06:38.980
We've seen documentation of hostages being held in Gaza in apartments and basements.

06:39.240 --> 06:43.020
They're spread through multiple locations as far as we know.

06:43.660 --> 06:51.560
The top officers in the military are currently presenting the political echelon and the security cabinet

06:51.560 --> 06:55.520
for the past two days with plausible military options to go forward.

06:55.520 --> 07:00.160
And of course, the hostages in their possible locations are being taken in.

07:00.180 --> 07:06.820
into account. As we decide what our next step is, Israel is a state that holds human life

07:06.820 --> 07:12.980
sacred and we will do everything in our power to ensure that they're coming back home safe.

07:12.980 --> 07:18.040
But this is who Hamas is. For years, they have been saying that this is their goal to eliminate

07:18.040 --> 07:22.040
the Jewish state, to kill as many Jewish people as possible, to kidnap Jewish people.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.360
And 48 hours ago, they showed their true face to the world.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.080
Let's talk about the airstrikes. You said that,

07:30.180 --> 07:36.500
Hamas targets and tunnels that allow Hamas fighters to get from Gaza into Israel have been hit

07:36.500 --> 07:43.240
by air strikes, but also residential tower blocks have and mosques as well. And we hear that more

07:43.240 --> 07:51.840
than 400 people have been killed, including children. So Palestinian civilians are being killed

07:51.840 --> 08:00.140
and injured in these air strikes, aren't they? We're at war. The IDF targets, military

08:00.180 --> 08:02.380
targets that are used by Hamas.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.500
Now, if Hamas treats

08:04.500 --> 08:06.300
their civilians for

08:06.300 --> 08:08.500
years as human shields,

08:08.820 --> 08:10.500
hiding ammunition

08:10.500 --> 08:12.380
storages, hiding rocket

08:12.380 --> 08:14.060
launchers beneath schools, beneath

08:14.060 --> 08:16.160
mosques, beneath UN facilities

08:16.160 --> 08:18.400
and kindergartens, we've seen

08:18.400 --> 08:20.200
how they treat Israeli citizens that

08:20.200 --> 08:22.480
they have kidnapped. The IDF strikes

08:22.480 --> 08:24.360
targets that we have intelligence on that are

08:24.360 --> 08:26.440
being used by Hamas for terrorism

08:26.440 --> 08:28.140
and the way that

08:28.140 --> 08:29.780
Hamas acts is entrenching themselves

08:29.780 --> 08:36.300
cynically within civilian population to make these actions more complicated for the IDF.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.340
Of course we are aware of that, but we are at war.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.720
Masha Mikulsson there, spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces.

08:42.920 --> 08:49.940
And I mentioned a family in that interview to that IDF spokesperson who are waiting for news

08:49.940 --> 08:54.460
on five relatives who have been abducted by Hamas fighters.

08:54.540 --> 08:58.460
We're going to play that interview with one of those family members later on in the program.

08:58.460 --> 09:03.560
Well, the number of Palestinians killed in the violence has also continued to rise.

09:03.660 --> 09:10.420
Health officials in Gaza said there is more than 400 deaths so far, and over 2,000 people have been injured.

09:10.540 --> 09:20.080
As Israel launches more air strikes on the territory, the Israeli Air Force says that it struck over 500 terrorist targets in Gaza overnight.

09:20.200 --> 09:26.000
Well, for more, we are now joined by Professor Lena Katibi, who is the director of the Middle East Institute,

09:26.000 --> 09:30.520
the School of Oriental and African Studies University here in London.

09:30.860 --> 09:33.420
Good morning to you and welcome to Newsday.

09:34.040 --> 09:39.800
In your opinion, what do you think Hamas militants launched the operation in the first place?

09:41.460 --> 09:51.180
The main reason is, of course, to try to put an end to the Israeli occupation that has been going on for many, many, many years.

09:51.640 --> 09:55.980
The situation in Gaza in particular is really very very.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.280
tough. It's been under siege for almost two decades. And Hamas wants to present itself to the

10:03.280 --> 10:09.500
Palestinians as the entity that can make a difference in that regard. So we have to remember here

10:09.500 --> 10:17.600
that the main goal for Hamas is political behind this military operation. It's not to just

10:17.600 --> 10:25.640
call short-term destabilization. It's actually to say this is a game-changing attack that puts

10:25.640 --> 10:33.240
Hamas as the central Palestinian entity for the world to kind of engage with.

10:33.380 --> 10:39.100
But then one would wonder with this attack and seen so many Palestinians dead and obviously

10:39.100 --> 10:46.780
the ongoing fighting is still on, how much support does that leave Hamas where we're in Gaza

10:46.780 --> 10:48.000
and among Palestinians?

10:48.440 --> 10:55.300
Actually, Hamas now enjoys white support for this attack. People are very aware of the

10:55.300 --> 11:01.900
high price that will be paid, because of course, Israel's retaliation is not going to be mild.

11:02.480 --> 11:06.560
And yet, they are so desperate that they feel they have nothing to lose.

11:07.800 --> 11:15.020
So that's why you're seeing not just in Gaza, but even wider in the Arab world,

11:15.220 --> 11:17.620
a lot of support expressed for Hamas.

11:18.220 --> 11:24.600
I think, you know, the Israel-Palestine conflict had been ignored for so long.

11:25.460 --> 11:28.600
that people feel desperate measures are needed.

11:29.280 --> 11:34.700
And you said that there's even more wider support for Hamas in the region as such.

11:35.020 --> 11:38.400
But looking at all that, you know, we're not only talking about infrastructures.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.780
There are lives and people who are being killed and injured,

11:42.020 --> 11:45.420
and some will probably hold hostages.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.640
I wonder then in your opinion, where does this go?

11:48.720 --> 11:51.300
How does this get solved, if anyone at all?

11:52.680 --> 11:58.000
The only way to resolve this situation is to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict.

11:58.300 --> 12:03.280
I mean, without the conflict having been protracted for many, many years,

12:03.420 --> 12:06.140
Hamas would not have existed in the first place.

12:06.520 --> 12:11.780
I mean, we have to remember in the 70s and 80s, early 80s, there was no Hamas.

12:11.860 --> 12:16.040
You know, it was Fatah, the PLO and some other groups,

12:16.360 --> 12:20.060
but Hamas is a relative newcomer in the history of the conflict

12:20.060 --> 12:25.900
and a product of the kind of stagnation of this conflict politically.

12:26.140 --> 12:29.640
So the only way to resolve this is to go back to politics

12:29.640 --> 12:34.700
and find a solution that is acceptable to Palestinians.

12:35.200 --> 12:39.220
I think, you know, these kinds of groups like Hamas

12:39.220 --> 12:43.560
basically find an opening in contracted conflict

12:43.560 --> 12:46.800
and try to assert themselves as a result.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.340
So we need the U.S. back on track.

12:49.340 --> 12:54.200
We need the UK, we need the international community at large to take this conflict seriously.

12:54.700 --> 13:03.480
We've already seen regional actors like Saudi Arabia saying they are serious about wanting to find a solution to this conflict as well.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.200
So I think this is the only way out.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.880
It's not about a military victory for anybody.

13:10.180 --> 13:13.740
It has to be a political solution that restores peace.

13:13.880 --> 13:19.080
And briefly, if you may, where does this leave then the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas,

13:19.080 --> 13:21.020
in those conversations about a solution?

13:22.280 --> 13:28.620
One of the things that is being achieved also by Hamas in this attack

13:28.620 --> 13:34.360
is to show the weakness of the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas.

13:34.560 --> 13:39.120
I think he's going to face increasing criticism from Palestinians

13:39.120 --> 13:41.900
about the failures of his leadership.

13:41.900 --> 13:47.260
And it is likely that in the aftermath of this attack,

13:47.260 --> 13:52.720
the Palestinian Authority will seek to find another leader to replace Abbas,

13:52.880 --> 13:55.380
although it's not clear who that leader could be,

13:55.440 --> 13:58.420
because there has not been a clear succession plan.

13:58.840 --> 14:02.740
But definitely something needs to change in that regard as well.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.780
Professor Lena Hatib, thank you for coming on to the program.

14:05.920 --> 14:12.640
She is the director of the Middle East Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies University here in London.

14:13.060 --> 14:17.240
Well, aid and refugee groups already warning that civilians on both sides have paid.

14:17.260 --> 14:19.900
and will continue to pay the heaviest price.

14:20.020 --> 14:24.600
More than 123,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza so far,

14:24.720 --> 14:28.180
with close to 74,000 seeking shelter in schools,

14:28.340 --> 14:29.980
according to the United Nations.

14:30.040 --> 14:35.540
Well, on the line now from Jerusalem is Shana Lowe of the Norwegian Refugee Council.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.740
Welcome to Newsday, Shana.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.000
What are your teams on the ground telling you?

14:41.060 --> 14:42.060
Good morning.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.900
Yes, I just spoke to my colleague in Gaza about an hour ago.

14:47.840 --> 14:52.400
Last night was a terrifying night full of bombardments.

14:52.720 --> 15:01.520
My colleague Yusuf has two young children and they are doing all that they can to protect their children, distract them from what's going on outside their windows.

15:02.080 --> 15:12.500
The night for them is, of course, the scariest time of night, time of day because they just do not know what will happen and it's when Israeli airstrikes really ramp up.

15:12.500 --> 15:18.900
In terms of our ability to operate on the ground in Gaza, we can't right now.

15:19.020 --> 15:24.700
Our staff has been told to shelter in place and take care of themselves and their families.

15:24.920 --> 15:37.780
And so we're desperately waiting for a cessation of the hostilities in order for our staff to be able to go out and assess the damage and provide needs and provide assistance to those who are in need.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.480
So even as the UN says more than 120,000 Palestinians currently don't have.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.920
have a home, you're unable to help them.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.080
Exactly.

15:47.560 --> 15:54.260
I mean, so long as there's ongoing hostilities, we cannot, in good conscience, we have a duty

15:54.260 --> 16:02.200
of care to our staff and we cannot send them out to go and provide assistance until we know

16:02.200 --> 16:04.260
that they can reach communities safely.

16:04.360 --> 16:04.820
Right.

16:05.000 --> 16:05.140
I see.

16:05.220 --> 16:07.680
What are you hearing from your team in Israel?

16:08.640 --> 16:12.060
Well, we actually don't operate in Israel.

16:12.500 --> 16:16.460
We operate only in the West, in occupied Palestinian territory,

16:16.560 --> 16:19.220
so that includes the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,

16:19.760 --> 16:22.120
and then also in the Gaza Strip.

16:22.200 --> 16:22.420
Right.

16:22.640 --> 16:29.240
Now, we know that the food situation was already stretched in Gaza

16:29.240 --> 16:31.940
before Saturday's events.

16:32.420 --> 16:36.280
What is your message to the international community

16:36.280 --> 16:39.140
about the kinds of help that is needed,

16:39.320 --> 16:42.140
and what is the likelihood that that help will be able to get through?

16:42.500 --> 17:12.440
Yeah. I mean, we need to have demands from the international community to call for, if not a cessation of the hostilities, at least a pause in which humanitarian actors can access Gaza and provide assistance. I understand that yesterday the crossing with Egypt was open and that some truckloads of food came in. But the reality in Gaza is that food supplies are always very short. There's not a lot of extra food that is stock.

17:12.500 --> 17:17.620
piled there. And so we, of course, are calling for a cessation and the hostilities so that

17:17.620 --> 17:24.700
the international community humanitarian organizations can bring in additional supplies for

17:24.700 --> 17:29.480
Palestinians in need. We heard from a spokesperson for the Israeli defense forces earlier on

17:29.480 --> 17:34.140
the program who was clear that if there is a location where they believe there is a Hamas

17:34.140 --> 17:40.760
fighter or leader, they will target that location. So what is your message to civilians in Gaza

17:40.760 --> 17:43.120
about whether they're at home or if they're displaced,

17:43.400 --> 17:45.100
about what they should do, where they should go?

17:45.740 --> 17:49.640
I mean, the reality is that there is no safe place in Gaza.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.460
For 16 years, Gaza has been besieged.

17:52.880 --> 17:58.520
Palestinians living there have very little ability to get in or to get out or move.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.940
It's one of the most densely populated places on Earth.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.020
2.2 million people are living there.

18:04.420 --> 18:10.680
And so when we hear remarks from Benjamin Netanyahu calling for Palestinians in

18:10.760 --> 18:19.160
Gaza to leave. Our question is, where should they go? Because Israel controls people's exit from

18:19.160 --> 18:26.340
the Gaza Strip into Israel. Yes, exactly. And the Egyptian border, my understanding is that it has

18:26.340 --> 18:32.660
been, was open yesterday, but the cost... For people to leave or not, do you know? Well, people can

18:32.660 --> 18:40.040
leave, but the cost, it's cost prohibitive. So the Israeli, the Egyptian authorities control the cost

18:40.040 --> 18:46.660
of exiting into Egypt and my understanding is that they have increased that cost considerably

18:46.660 --> 18:52.240
and there are limitations in terms of the number, the capacity that they have at this time

18:52.240 --> 18:55.400
to be letting people flee for safety.

18:55.660 --> 19:00.140
All right. Thanks very much. That's Shane Lowe there from the Norwegian Refugee Council who was on the

19:00.140 --> 19:06.260
line from Jerusalem. And joining us back in the studio, is Isaac Fennon with all this four.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.880
Arsenal got a massive 1-0 win

19:10.880 --> 19:13.220
over Manchester City in the Premier League

19:13.220 --> 19:15.040
Gabrielle Martinelli scoring the winner

19:15.040 --> 19:17.920
it was the Garner's first win in City in the league

19:17.920 --> 19:20.980
since 2015. Here's their manager, Mikhail Arteta.

19:21.300 --> 19:24.380
It's been a long time since the club hasn't beat

19:24.380 --> 19:27.540
Man City and we discussed that a lot

19:27.540 --> 19:29.900
and we felt like today could be the day

19:29.900 --> 19:32.320
but we needed a big performance, a huge individual

19:32.980 --> 19:34.560
performances and we had that

19:34.560 --> 19:36.240
and with a bit of luck we managed to win the game.

19:36.260 --> 19:41.380
For City, it's two defeats in the row in the Premier League for the first time in five years,

19:41.440 --> 19:44.360
but manager Pep Guardiola says it's not the time to panic.

19:44.660 --> 19:45.320
We're in October.

19:45.740 --> 19:47.780
People say, okay, this year is not going to happen.

19:48.180 --> 19:50.080
We're not going to win the Premier League four times in a row.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.060
Listen, no team in all history have won four premiers in a row,

19:54.440 --> 19:55.700
but we're in October.

19:56.260 --> 19:59.200
And from my experience, as a manager, this is a long, long road.

19:59.540 --> 20:04.280
European football's governing body, UEFA has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel

20:04.280 --> 20:05.420
during the next fortnight

20:05.420 --> 20:07.340
amid increased tension in the region.

20:07.780 --> 20:09.540
Israel were due to play Switzerland

20:09.540 --> 20:13.240
in a Euro-20204 qualifier in Tel Aviv,

20:13.340 --> 20:14.840
but that game has been rescheduled.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.740
And UEFA said it will assess the situation

20:16.740 --> 20:18.520
over the coming days to see

20:18.520 --> 20:21.020
whether Israel's European Championship qualifier

20:21.020 --> 20:24.640
in Kosovo can take place in October.

20:25.260 --> 20:27.900
Simone Biles secured another two gold medals

20:27.900 --> 20:29.660
at the World Gymnastics Championships.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.740
Her 22nd and 23rd, she won

20:32.740 --> 20:34.040
the beam and for all

20:34.040 --> 20:35.460
titles to add to the team

20:35.460 --> 20:37.040
and all around success

20:37.040 --> 20:39.180
earlier on in the competition.

20:39.340 --> 20:41.180
She's got four gold medals

20:41.180 --> 20:43.020
on her return to the sport.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.900
She is the most decorated gymnast

20:44.900 --> 20:46.820
in the sports history

20:46.820 --> 20:47.840
and she's done all this

20:47.840 --> 20:49.380
having taken some time off

20:49.380 --> 20:50.500
after the Tokyo Olympics

20:50.500 --> 20:52.860
to focus on her mental health.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.240
It hasn't been easy.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.220
I've been focusing a lot

20:55.220 --> 20:56.660
on my gymnastics and my mental

20:56.660 --> 20:57.680
going to therapy,

20:57.820 --> 20:58.860
making sure that's in my regular

20:58.860 --> 21:01.060
scheduled routine as of anything else

21:01.060 --> 21:02.360
but I'm really proud of the work

21:02.360 --> 21:05.720
that I put in because at the beginning of the year I wasn't sure I was going to be competing

21:05.720 --> 21:10.660
and I actually wasn't supposed to be competing so to end up here now at world at the end of

21:10.660 --> 21:16.340
the year it's just like I just keep amazing myself there was a huge result in the rugby world

21:16.340 --> 21:23.420
cup as Portugal beat Fiji 2423 to claim their first ever win at their first ever world

21:23.420 --> 21:32.340
cup here's their player nicholas martin so incredible work a lot for that I don't know where to

21:32.360 --> 21:39.220
say that it's a historic. I'm so happy. I think it's the best moment of my life. We are a team of

21:39.220 --> 21:48.220
friends from France, from Portugal, but we live together. It's something incredible. Now despite

21:48.220 --> 21:53.000
their second loss of the group phase, Fiji are still through to the quarterfinals. They will

21:53.000 --> 22:00.520
play England next weekend in Marseille. And finally, Kenyan Kelvin Kippem shattered the men's

22:00.520 --> 22:02.540
marathon world record in Chicago

22:02.540 --> 22:04.940
as he beat compatria elid Kipchoga's

22:04.940 --> 22:06.720
previous mark by more than

22:06.720 --> 22:08.840
30 seconds, the 23-year-old

22:08.840 --> 22:10.740
finished in a time of two hours

22:10.740 --> 22:12.320
and 35 seconds.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.960
Isaac Fenning, thank you so much

22:17.960 --> 22:20.360
for that news about the sporting world.

22:20.460 --> 22:22.340
Now this is news there with Vic and

22:22.340 --> 22:24.400
Rob in other news this morning

22:24.400 --> 22:26.400
an independent inquiry in the UK

22:26.400 --> 22:27.880
will begin hearings today.

22:28.420 --> 22:30.400
Interlegations that British Special Force

22:30.520 --> 22:36.320
killed dozens of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2013.

22:36.320 --> 22:41.400
The inquiry was set up after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.

22:41.840 --> 22:44.440
The U.S. state-majority leader Chuck Schumer,

22:44.540 --> 22:50.220
who is leading a bipartisan delegation to China, has met with the Foreign Minister Wang Yi,

22:50.360 --> 22:53.680
Mr. Schumer, is the latest high-level American official to visit

22:53.680 --> 22:56.960
as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.

22:57.100 --> 23:00.500
Mr. Wang said he hoped that the visit would help the U.S.

23:00.520 --> 23:04.820
to view its relationship with China in a more objective way.

23:05.020 --> 23:09.060
And in Ecuador, the state of emergency has been extended by 30 days.

23:09.580 --> 23:16.340
It's been in place since the assassination in August of anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Villasthensio.

23:16.680 --> 23:22.660
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were found dead in prison.

23:23.020 --> 23:25.880
Now, we're going to return to our main story now.

23:25.920 --> 23:30.340
It is more than 48 hours after Saturday's unprecedented assault by fighters.

23:30.520 --> 23:36.980
belonging to Hamas, which is designated as a terror organisation by any Western nations on Israel.

23:37.200 --> 23:45.240
And Hamas claims to have abducted more than 100 Israelis, with many taken over the boundary from Israel, into Gaza.

23:45.500 --> 23:49.560
Some of them are believed to be Israeli soldiers, and many are civilians.

23:49.680 --> 23:54.380
We've been contacted by a family anxious to know about the fate of their five relatives

23:54.380 --> 23:59.440
who've been taken away from the kibbutz of Nahalz, which is a few kilometers from Gaza.

24:00.520 --> 24:04.980
on Sunday night to Yadin, who told me more about her missing relatives.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.760
And she says she watched a Facebook live video

24:07.760 --> 24:10.860
in which she could see them being taken,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.660
she thought, across the boundary into Gaza by these abductors.

24:15.220 --> 24:18.420
My aunt's partner, he got shot in the leg.

24:18.920 --> 24:21.400
I don't know how. I don't know what happened before.

24:22.020 --> 24:25.260
But we just saw the Hamas people taking them away.

24:26.140 --> 24:30.420
They took the younger brother of my aunt family.

24:30.520 --> 24:33.960
and ask them to walk with them around the kibbutz

24:33.960 --> 24:36.700
to ask people in Hebrew to open doors

24:36.700 --> 24:39.160
so they can take them away or I don't know

24:39.160 --> 24:40.400
do whatever they want

24:40.400 --> 24:44.120
if people didn't open the door and listen to them

24:44.120 --> 24:46.180
they just shut the door

24:46.180 --> 24:48.920
and shut the people whichever they want

24:48.920 --> 24:51.220
and took the rest in captivity

24:51.220 --> 24:54.460
we don't know if they took them across the border

24:54.460 --> 24:57.120
or just leave them there we have no idea

24:57.120 --> 25:00.060
and you could see all of this on the video on Facebook

25:00.060 --> 25:10.460
Yeah, it's 30 minutes live. Other than that, we just lost contact, so there is no service or anything you can reach them.

25:10.640 --> 25:20.460
They are two little kids, two little daughters of the partner who we don't know where they are, if they are together, if somebody is taking care of them.

25:20.580 --> 25:26.380
There is another child who is 17 years old. It's a frightening situation.

25:26.380 --> 25:30.860
You said that your aunt's partner appeared to have been shot in the leg.

25:31.020 --> 25:35.440
Was it clear from the video whether he'd been given any medical care,

25:35.760 --> 25:37.480
and how did the others in the video look?

25:38.040 --> 25:43.000
One of the many videos that we saw is we saw,

25:43.280 --> 25:48.540
Noam, the aunt partner, taking people of the Hamas,

25:48.800 --> 25:51.200
is helping him walk through the border.

25:51.580 --> 25:54.200
Like for a two-second shot, you can see it.

25:54.660 --> 25:56.360
Other than that, we don't know anything.

25:56.380 --> 26:01.220
anything. We just saw him walking very poorly.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.000
How does that make you feel knowing that they've been taken

26:05.000 --> 26:07.460
or suspecting they've been taken to Gaza?

26:08.480 --> 26:12.060
Terrible. All I can think is why the hell should I know

26:12.060 --> 26:17.380
they are being kept in Gaza via channel and Instagram.

26:18.280 --> 26:22.940
Presumably you've called your aunt's phone. Does it ring? Does anybody answer?

26:24.640 --> 26:35.820
Actually, at the beginning, when some people try to text her, the Hamas answered the phone and wrote in English.

26:36.100 --> 26:40.460
But other than that, when we try to call now, there is no line.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.660
You don't reach to anything.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.720
It's ringing, but nobody answered.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.440
Have you spoken to the police?

26:46.500 --> 26:48.140
Have you spoken to people in the army?

26:48.400 --> 26:49.020
We try.

26:49.180 --> 26:52.560
Even during the library, we call the authorities.

26:52.940 --> 26:59.160
And they all say they're aware of the problem and they really don't have something to do right now.

26:59.260 --> 27:03.720
It is a chaos. It is really a chaos. It was a chaos. It's still a chaos.

27:04.160 --> 27:11.840
People don't know how to manage. It was really a surprise attack. People don't know how to manage the situation.

27:12.320 --> 27:19.000
What do you and the rest of the family want the authorities to do when it comes to your aunt, her partner and his children?

27:19.100 --> 27:22.920
We want to bring them home safe. No matter what, the people,

27:22.940 --> 27:27.580
prices. I think we all, the toll

27:27.580 --> 27:30.460
they took from us, we have

27:30.460 --> 27:34.480
700 people killed, a thousand of people injured

27:34.480 --> 27:40.940
in, not several injuries, like, wounded very hard.

27:41.740 --> 27:44.820
It's not supposed to be in the civilians, people.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.700
Civilians shouldn't be paying this price.

27:47.920 --> 27:52.400
Your family is clearly going through a very worrying, harrowing time at the

27:52.400 --> 27:54.020
moment. What is it like

27:54.020 --> 27:56.240
being an Israeli right now?

27:56.380 --> 27:57.900
It's a bit disappointing.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.180
It's a bit hard. It's

28:00.180 --> 28:02.560
unknown. You don't know

28:02.560 --> 28:04.380
what's going to be tomorrow.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.400
Is there a B attack

28:06.400 --> 28:07.800
also from Hezbollah?

28:08.440 --> 28:10.380
Things are going to cool down.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.140
Somebody is going to

28:12.140 --> 28:14.080
take care of all the people who

28:14.080 --> 28:16.080
got injured, who is

28:16.080 --> 28:18.260
not home, who is dead.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.740
There is so many

28:19.740 --> 28:21.620
questions you need to be asked and

28:22.780 --> 28:23.920
I don't know.

28:24.540 --> 28:26.840
You feel a lot of things right now in Israel.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.320
But we all feel very divided.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.960
That was Yadin there, who didn't want us to use her surname

28:33.960 --> 28:39.120
talking about her aunt and her partner and their children,

28:39.220 --> 28:42.540
including 8-year-old Ella, who they watched being

28:42.540 --> 28:47.700
abducted by Hamas Fighters on a Facebook live video on Saturday.

28:47.700 --> 28:51.180
We did put her point that the authorities had done very little

28:51.180 --> 28:56.000
and her view to the Israeli military spokesperson we had on the program and she said that they

28:56.000 --> 29:02.900
would work to try to recover all of the people who had been taken. That is it for this

29:02.900 --> 29:08.080
edition of Newsday. More on that continuing situation in the Middle East on the BBC website
