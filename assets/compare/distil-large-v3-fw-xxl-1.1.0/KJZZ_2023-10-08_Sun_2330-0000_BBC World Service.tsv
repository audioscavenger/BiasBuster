14800	20280	Hello and welcome to Newsday from the BBC World Service with Rob Young and Victoria Oonghunda.
20440	25720	Israel is responding to Hamas' surprise attacks at the weekend with a series of airstrikes in Gaza.
25920	29220	Palestinian health officials say more than 400 people have been killed.
29440	33640	Israel says that more than 700 of its citizens have died in their attacks so far.
33800	35460	We get the latest from both sides.
35960	38220	The first is summary of the latest world news.
43560	45600	BBC News with Emily Thomas.
46560	52640	Israeli military has said its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over 500 targets
52640	58580	overnight in the Gaza Strip. Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants
58580	64560	in several locations inside Israel two days after they carried out a devastating mass assault.
64800	71440	More than 700 Israelis have been killed. Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians
71440	74880	have been killed by Israeli air strikes before the latest barrage.
75960	80700	Hamas said it had fired missiles targeting Ben-Gurian airport near Tel Aviv.
81320	87460	Three U.S. air carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended services to Tel Aviv,
87960	91020	but some evacuation flights have taken place from the airport.
91340	97380	The UN Security Council has held an emergency meeting in New York to discuss the crisis behind closed doors.
97700	102740	The UN Middle East envoy called on all countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.
103860	109900	In other news, an independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into allegations
109900	116660	that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2013.
117090	121480	The inquiry was set up after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.
122360	128160	The US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to China,
128620	130360	has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
130360	133840	Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit
133840	137320	as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.

140320	143640	to view its relationship with China in a more objective way.
144740	148800	In Ecuador, the state of emergency has been extended by 30 days.

151380	155160	of the anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio.
155440	159200	The extension comes to days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing
159200	160780	were found dead in prison.
161260	162120	BBC News.
166400	168500	Emily, thank you for that news summary.
168640	169900	Hello and welcome to Newsday.
170080	172120	We will be focusing this half hour
172120	173660	on the latest development
173660	175480	inside Gaza and Israel
175480	177140	and hear from a aid organization
177140	178720	as to what can be done
178720	180540	to avoid more civilian deaths.
180740	183620	And we also have a full bulletin
183620	185440	of sports who do stay with us.
185440	186780	It's me, Vic and Rob
186780	188280	and Isaac Fennon later on.
192600	198000	Well, we start this half hour of the program with the latest developments in Gaza and Israel.
198220	202540	It is now two days since Hamas militants launched a wave of attacks against Israel.
203120	206580	Hamas runs Gaza where more than two million Palestinians live,
206780	211040	and Hamas is also designated as a terror group by much of the Western world.
211780	213820	The death toll continues to rise.
214060	217520	700 Israelis have been killed and over 2,000 injured.
217960	221380	In retaliation, Israel has launched airstrikes on the Gaza Strip,
221380	224820	which have killed at least 413 people.
225380	227660	And battles are continuing inside Israel
227660	231240	between the Israeli Defence Forces and Hamas fighters.
231360	233620	For the latest, I've been talking to a spokesperson
233620	237020	for the Israeli Defence Forces, Masha Mikkelson,
237160	240840	and I asked if there are still fighters in Israel at the moment.
241440	242540	Yes, there are.
242800	245660	There's fighting still going on in several points
245660	247780	in the community surrounding the Gaza Strip.
247880	251180	We're talking about Berri, Reim,
251380	258060	Kfar Aza, the Zikkim military base, there's ongoing combat, and it's a thing that takes
258060	264840	hours, multiple hours, to clear those terrorists out, and the idea of is focusing right now
264840	270240	on getting the southern part of Israel back to normal without terrorists on Israeli soil.
270340	272480	How long do you think it will take to get it back to normal?
273420	279460	It's hard to say. We hoped we would be in a better situation by the end of yesterday,
279460	281540	but they're still fighting going on.
281920	284040	This is our main objective throughout the day
284040	285820	to save as many lives as possible
285820	289100	and get the terrorists out of Israel,
289720	290600	whatever it takes.
291380	292740	While we're doing that,
292880	295620	IDF aircrafts are striking in Gaza,
296020	298620	hundreds of military Hamas terrorist targets.
301120	306680	We have seen around 880 targets
306680	309740	that have been struck, including terror tunnels.
311440	314820	That's, of course, in response to over 3,300 rockets
314820	318400	that were fired from the Gaza Strip in addition to the invasion.
318500	321120	I'm going to come back to the airstrikes in just a moment.
321580	325180	Do you know whether there are still Hamas fighters entering Israel,
325440	329220	or is that boundary between Israel and the Gaza Strip secure?
331500	336660	There are Hamas people trying to infiltrate Israel, yes, still as we speak,
336680	341560	They were being met with fire from IDF UAVs that are surveilling the area of the border.
342240	348380	When they entered two days ago in the morning, they blew up significant part of the fence.
348380	353540	So there are still breached points of the fence that we are securing through the year.
353980	359560	Do you know how many people have been abducted and taken from Israel to Gaza?
360500	363300	We don't have the exact numbers, but it's in the dozens.
363640	363920	Right.
363920	390180	Right. We spoke to one family an hour ago on this program. They think that five members of their family, including an eight-year-old girl, have been taken. And they contacted us because they were worried that the authorities were not doing all they could to try to secure their return. If you don't know exactly how many people have been taken, do you have any idea where these people are? And what are you intending to do to try to secure their release?
390180	398980	We've seen documentation of hostages being held in Gaza in apartments and basements.
399240	403020	They're spread through multiple locations as far as we know.
403660	411560	The top officers in the military are currently presenting the political echelon and the security cabinet
411560	415520	for the past two days with plausible military options to go forward.
415520	420160	And of course, the hostages in their possible locations are being taken in.
420180	426820	into account. As we decide what our next step is, Israel is a state that holds human life
426820	432980	sacred and we will do everything in our power to ensure that they're coming back home safe.
432980	438040	But this is who Hamas is. For years, they have been saying that this is their goal to eliminate
438040	442040	the Jewish state, to kill as many Jewish people as possible, to kidnap Jewish people.
443040	446360	And 48 hours ago, they showed their true face to the world.
447180	450080	Let's talk about the airstrikes. You said that,
450180	456500	Hamas targets and tunnels that allow Hamas fighters to get from Gaza into Israel have been hit
456500	463240	by air strikes, but also residential tower blocks have and mosques as well. And we hear that more
463240	471840	than 400 people have been killed, including children. So Palestinian civilians are being killed
471840	480140	and injured in these air strikes, aren't they? We're at war. The IDF targets, military
480180	482380	targets that are used by Hamas.
482560	484500	Now, if Hamas treats
484500	486300	their civilians for
486300	488500	years as human shields,
488820	490500	hiding ammunition
490500	492380	storages, hiding rocket
492380	494060	launchers beneath schools, beneath
494060	496160	mosques, beneath UN facilities
496160	498400	and kindergartens, we've seen
498400	500200	how they treat Israeli citizens that
500200	502480	they have kidnapped. The IDF strikes
502480	504360	targets that we have intelligence on that are
504360	506440	being used by Hamas for terrorism
506440	508140	and the way that
508140	509780	Hamas acts is entrenching themselves
509780	516300	cynically within civilian population to make these actions more complicated for the IDF.
516380	518340	Of course we are aware of that, but we are at war.
519200	522720	Masha Mikulsson there, spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces.
522920	529940	And I mentioned a family in that interview to that IDF spokesperson who are waiting for news
529940	534460	on five relatives who have been abducted by Hamas fighters.
534540	538460	We're going to play that interview with one of those family members later on in the program.
538460	543560	Well, the number of Palestinians killed in the violence has also continued to rise.
543660	550420	Health officials in Gaza said there is more than 400 deaths so far, and over 2,000 people have been injured.
550540	560080	As Israel launches more air strikes on the territory, the Israeli Air Force says that it struck over 500 terrorist targets in Gaza overnight.
560200	566000	Well, for more, we are now joined by Professor Lena Katibi, who is the director of the Middle East Institute,
566000	570520	the School of Oriental and African Studies University here in London.
570860	573420	Good morning to you and welcome to Newsday.
574040	579800	In your opinion, what do you think Hamas militants launched the operation in the first place?
581460	591180	The main reason is, of course, to try to put an end to the Israeli occupation that has been going on for many, many, many years.
591640	595980	The situation in Gaza in particular is really very very.
596000	603280	tough. It's been under siege for almost two decades. And Hamas wants to present itself to the
603280	609500	Palestinians as the entity that can make a difference in that regard. So we have to remember here
609500	617600	that the main goal for Hamas is political behind this military operation. It's not to just
617600	625640	call short-term destabilization. It's actually to say this is a game-changing attack that puts
625640	633240	Hamas as the central Palestinian entity for the world to kind of engage with.
633380	639100	But then one would wonder with this attack and seen so many Palestinians dead and obviously
639100	646780	the ongoing fighting is still on, how much support does that leave Hamas where we're in Gaza
646780	648000	and among Palestinians?
648440	655300	Actually, Hamas now enjoys white support for this attack. People are very aware of the
655300	661900	high price that will be paid, because of course, Israel's retaliation is not going to be mild.
662480	666560	And yet, they are so desperate that they feel they have nothing to lose.
667800	675020	So that's why you're seeing not just in Gaza, but even wider in the Arab world,
675220	677620	a lot of support expressed for Hamas.
678220	684600	I think, you know, the Israel-Palestine conflict had been ignored for so long.
685460	688600	that people feel desperate measures are needed.
689280	694700	And you said that there's even more wider support for Hamas in the region as such.
695020	698400	But looking at all that, you know, we're not only talking about infrastructures.
698600	701780	There are lives and people who are being killed and injured,
702020	705420	and some will probably hold hostages.
705900	708640	I wonder then in your opinion, where does this go?
708720	711300	How does this get solved, if anyone at all?
712680	718000	The only way to resolve this situation is to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict.
718300	723280	I mean, without the conflict having been protracted for many, many years,
723420	726140	Hamas would not have existed in the first place.
726520	731780	I mean, we have to remember in the 70s and 80s, early 80s, there was no Hamas.
731860	736040	You know, it was Fatah, the PLO and some other groups,
736360	740060	but Hamas is a relative newcomer in the history of the conflict
740060	745900	and a product of the kind of stagnation of this conflict politically.
746140	749640	So the only way to resolve this is to go back to politics
749640	754700	and find a solution that is acceptable to Palestinians.
755200	759220	I think, you know, these kinds of groups like Hamas
759220	763560	basically find an opening in contracted conflict
763560	766800	and try to assert themselves as a result.
766960	769340	So we need the U.S. back on track.
769340	774200	We need the UK, we need the international community at large to take this conflict seriously.
774700	783480	We've already seen regional actors like Saudi Arabia saying they are serious about wanting to find a solution to this conflict as well.
783520	786200	So I think this is the only way out.
786300	789880	It's not about a military victory for anybody.
790180	793740	It has to be a political solution that restores peace.
793880	799080	And briefly, if you may, where does this leave then the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas,
799080	801020	in those conversations about a solution?
802280	808620	One of the things that is being achieved also by Hamas in this attack
808620	814360	is to show the weakness of the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas.
814560	819120	I think he's going to face increasing criticism from Palestinians
819120	821900	about the failures of his leadership.
821900	827260	And it is likely that in the aftermath of this attack,
827260	832720	the Palestinian Authority will seek to find another leader to replace Abbas,
832880	835380	although it's not clear who that leader could be,
835440	838420	because there has not been a clear succession plan.
838840	842740	But definitely something needs to change in that regard as well.
843080	845780	Professor Lena Hatib, thank you for coming on to the program.
845920	852640	She is the director of the Middle East Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies University here in London.
853060	857240	Well, aid and refugee groups already warning that civilians on both sides have paid.
857260	859900	and will continue to pay the heaviest price.
860020	864600	More than 123,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza so far,
864720	868180	with close to 74,000 seeking shelter in schools,
868340	869980	according to the United Nations.
870040	875540	Well, on the line now from Jerusalem is Shana Lowe of the Norwegian Refugee Council.
875740	877740	Welcome to Newsday, Shana.
877800	880000	What are your teams on the ground telling you?
881060	882060	Good morning.
882200	886900	Yes, I just spoke to my colleague in Gaza about an hour ago.
887840	892400	Last night was a terrifying night full of bombardments.
892720	901520	My colleague Yusuf has two young children and they are doing all that they can to protect their children, distract them from what's going on outside their windows.
902080	912500	The night for them is, of course, the scariest time of night, time of day because they just do not know what will happen and it's when Israeli airstrikes really ramp up.
912500	918900	In terms of our ability to operate on the ground in Gaza, we can't right now.
919020	924700	Our staff has been told to shelter in place and take care of themselves and their families.
924920	937780	And so we're desperately waiting for a cessation of the hostilities in order for our staff to be able to go out and assess the damage and provide needs and provide assistance to those who are in need.
937800	942480	So even as the UN says more than 120,000 Palestinians currently don't have.
942500	945920	have a home, you're unable to help them.
946520	947080	Exactly.
947560	954260	I mean, so long as there's ongoing hostilities, we cannot, in good conscience, we have a duty
954260	962200	of care to our staff and we cannot send them out to go and provide assistance until we know
962200	964260	that they can reach communities safely.
964360	964820	Right.
965000	965140	I see.
965220	967680	What are you hearing from your team in Israel?
968640	972060	Well, we actually don't operate in Israel.
972500	976460	We operate only in the West, in occupied Palestinian territory,
976560	979220	so that includes the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,
979760	982120	and then also in the Gaza Strip.
982200	982420	Right.
982640	989240	Now, we know that the food situation was already stretched in Gaza
989240	991940	before Saturday's events.
992420	996280	What is your message to the international community
996280	999140	about the kinds of help that is needed,
999320	1002140	and what is the likelihood that that help will be able to get through?
1002500	1032440	Yeah. I mean, we need to have demands from the international community to call for, if not a cessation of the hostilities, at least a pause in which humanitarian actors can access Gaza and provide assistance. I understand that yesterday the crossing with Egypt was open and that some truckloads of food came in. But the reality in Gaza is that food supplies are always very short. There's not a lot of extra food that is stock.
1032500	1037620	piled there. And so we, of course, are calling for a cessation and the hostilities so that
1037620	1044700	the international community humanitarian organizations can bring in additional supplies for
1044700	1049480	Palestinians in need. We heard from a spokesperson for the Israeli defense forces earlier on
1049480	1054140	the program who was clear that if there is a location where they believe there is a Hamas
1054140	1060760	fighter or leader, they will target that location. So what is your message to civilians in Gaza
1060760	1063120	about whether they're at home or if they're displaced,
1063400	1065100	about what they should do, where they should go?
1065740	1069640	I mean, the reality is that there is no safe place in Gaza.
1069920	1072460	For 16 years, Gaza has been besieged.
1072880	1078520	Palestinians living there have very little ability to get in or to get out or move.
1078720	1081940	It's one of the most densely populated places on Earth.
1082100	1084020	2.2 million people are living there.
1084420	1090680	And so when we hear remarks from Benjamin Netanyahu calling for Palestinians in
1090760	1099160	Gaza to leave. Our question is, where should they go? Because Israel controls people's exit from
1099160	1106340	the Gaza Strip into Israel. Yes, exactly. And the Egyptian border, my understanding is that it has
1106340	1112660	been, was open yesterday, but the cost... For people to leave or not, do you know? Well, people can
1112660	1120040	leave, but the cost, it's cost prohibitive. So the Israeli, the Egyptian authorities control the cost
1120040	1126660	of exiting into Egypt and my understanding is that they have increased that cost considerably
1126660	1132240	and there are limitations in terms of the number, the capacity that they have at this time
1132240	1135400	to be letting people flee for safety.
1135660	1140140	All right. Thanks very much. That's Shane Lowe there from the Norwegian Refugee Council who was on the
1140140	1146260	line from Jerusalem. And joining us back in the studio, is Isaac Fennon with all this four.
1148680	1150880	Arsenal got a massive 1-0 win
1150880	1153220	over Manchester City in the Premier League
1153220	1155040	Gabrielle Martinelli scoring the winner
1155040	1157920	it was the Garner's first win in City in the league
1157920	1160980	since 2015. Here's their manager, Mikhail Arteta.
1161300	1164380	It's been a long time since the club hasn't beat
1164380	1167540	Man City and we discussed that a lot
1167540	1169900	and we felt like today could be the day
1169900	1172320	but we needed a big performance, a huge individual
1172980	1174560	performances and we had that
1174560	1176240	and with a bit of luck we managed to win the game.
1176260	1181380	For City, it's two defeats in the row in the Premier League for the first time in five years,
1181440	1184360	but manager Pep Guardiola says it's not the time to panic.
1184660	1185320	We're in October.
1185740	1187780	People say, okay, this year is not going to happen.
1188180	1190080	We're not going to win the Premier League four times in a row.
1190600	1194060	Listen, no team in all history have won four premiers in a row,
1194440	1195700	but we're in October.
1196260	1199200	And from my experience, as a manager, this is a long, long road.
1199540	1204280	European football's governing body, UEFA has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel
1204280	1205420	during the next fortnight
1205420	1207340	amid increased tension in the region.
1207780	1209540	Israel were due to play Switzerland
1209540	1213240	in a Euro-20204 qualifier in Tel Aviv,
1213340	1214840	but that game has been rescheduled.
1214980	1216740	And UEFA said it will assess the situation
1216740	1218520	over the coming days to see
1218520	1221020	whether Israel's European Championship qualifier
1221020	1224640	in Kosovo can take place in October.
1225260	1227900	Simone Biles secured another two gold medals
1227900	1229660	at the World Gymnastics Championships.
1229900	1232740	Her 22nd and 23rd, she won
1232740	1234040	the beam and for all
1234040	1235460	titles to add to the team
1235460	1237040	and all around success
1237040	1239180	earlier on in the competition.
1239340	1241180	She's got four gold medals
1241180	1243020	on her return to the sport.
1243080	1244900	She is the most decorated gymnast
1244900	1246820	in the sports history
1246820	1247840	and she's done all this
1247840	1249380	having taken some time off
1249380	1250500	after the Tokyo Olympics
1250500	1252860	to focus on her mental health.
1253160	1254240	It hasn't been easy.
1254340	1255220	I've been focusing a lot
1255220	1256660	on my gymnastics and my mental
1256660	1257680	going to therapy,
1257820	1258860	making sure that's in my regular
1258860	1261060	scheduled routine as of anything else
1261060	1262360	but I'm really proud of the work
1262360	1265720	that I put in because at the beginning of the year I wasn't sure I was going to be competing
1265720	1270660	and I actually wasn't supposed to be competing so to end up here now at world at the end of
1270660	1276340	the year it's just like I just keep amazing myself there was a huge result in the rugby world
1276340	1283420	cup as Portugal beat Fiji 2423 to claim their first ever win at their first ever world
1283420	1292340	cup here's their player nicholas martin so incredible work a lot for that I don't know where to
1292360	1299220	say that it's a historic. I'm so happy. I think it's the best moment of my life. We are a team of
1299220	1308220	friends from France, from Portugal, but we live together. It's something incredible. Now despite
1308220	1313000	their second loss of the group phase, Fiji are still through to the quarterfinals. They will
1313000	1320520	play England next weekend in Marseille. And finally, Kenyan Kelvin Kippem shattered the men's
1320520	1322540	marathon world record in Chicago
1322540	1324940	as he beat compatria elid Kipchoga's
1324940	1326720	previous mark by more than
1326720	1328840	30 seconds, the 23-year-old
1328840	1330740	finished in a time of two hours
1330740	1332320	and 35 seconds.
1335960	1337960	Isaac Fenning, thank you so much
1337960	1340360	for that news about the sporting world.
1340460	1342340	Now this is news there with Vic and
1342340	1344400	Rob in other news this morning
1344400	1346400	an independent inquiry in the UK
1346400	1347880	will begin hearings today.
1348420	1350400	Interlegations that British Special Force
1350520	1356320	killed dozens of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2013.
1356320	1361400	The inquiry was set up after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.
1361840	1364440	The U.S. state-majority leader Chuck Schumer,
1364540	1370220	who is leading a bipartisan delegation to China, has met with the Foreign Minister Wang Yi,
1370360	1373680	Mr. Schumer, is the latest high-level American official to visit
1373680	1376960	as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.
1377100	1380500	Mr. Wang said he hoped that the visit would help the U.S.
1380520	1384820	to view its relationship with China in a more objective way.
1385020	1389060	And in Ecuador, the state of emergency has been extended by 30 days.
1389580	1396340	It's been in place since the assassination in August of anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Villasthensio.
1396680	1402660	The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were found dead in prison.
1403020	1405880	Now, we're going to return to our main story now.
1405920	1410340	It is more than 48 hours after Saturday's unprecedented assault by fighters.
1410520	1416980	belonging to Hamas, which is designated as a terror organisation by any Western nations on Israel.
1417200	1425240	And Hamas claims to have abducted more than 100 Israelis, with many taken over the boundary from Israel, into Gaza.
1425500	1429560	Some of them are believed to be Israeli soldiers, and many are civilians.
1429680	1434380	We've been contacted by a family anxious to know about the fate of their five relatives
1434380	1439440	who've been taken away from the kibbutz of Nahalz, which is a few kilometers from Gaza.
1440520	1444980	on Sunday night to Yadin, who told me more about her missing relatives.
1445240	1447760	And she says she watched a Facebook live video
1447760	1450860	in which she could see them being taken,
1451000	1454660	she thought, across the boundary into Gaza by these abductors.
1455220	1458420	My aunt's partner, he got shot in the leg.
1458920	1461400	I don't know how. I don't know what happened before.
1462020	1465260	But we just saw the Hamas people taking them away.
1466140	1470420	They took the younger brother of my aunt family.
1470520	1473960	and ask them to walk with them around the kibbutz
1473960	1476700	to ask people in Hebrew to open doors
1476700	1479160	so they can take them away or I don't know
1479160	1480400	do whatever they want
1480400	1484120	if people didn't open the door and listen to them
1484120	1486180	they just shut the door
1486180	1488920	and shut the people whichever they want
1488920	1491220	and took the rest in captivity
1491220	1494460	we don't know if they took them across the border
1494460	1497120	or just leave them there we have no idea
1497120	1500060	and you could see all of this on the video on Facebook
1500060	1510460	Yeah, it's 30 minutes live. Other than that, we just lost contact, so there is no service or anything you can reach them.
1510640	1520460	They are two little kids, two little daughters of the partner who we don't know where they are, if they are together, if somebody is taking care of them.
1520580	1526380	There is another child who is 17 years old. It's a frightening situation.
1526380	1530860	You said that your aunt's partner appeared to have been shot in the leg.
1531020	1535440	Was it clear from the video whether he'd been given any medical care,
1535760	1537480	and how did the others in the video look?
1538040	1543000	One of the many videos that we saw is we saw,
1543280	1548540	Noam, the aunt partner, taking people of the Hamas,
1548800	1551200	is helping him walk through the border.
1551580	1554200	Like for a two-second shot, you can see it.
1554660	1556360	Other than that, we don't know anything.
1556380	1561220	anything. We just saw him walking very poorly.
1562160	1565000	How does that make you feel knowing that they've been taken
1565000	1567460	or suspecting they've been taken to Gaza?
1568480	1572060	Terrible. All I can think is why the hell should I know
1572060	1577380	they are being kept in Gaza via channel and Instagram.
1578280	1582940	Presumably you've called your aunt's phone. Does it ring? Does anybody answer?
1584640	1595820	Actually, at the beginning, when some people try to text her, the Hamas answered the phone and wrote in English.
1596100	1600460	But other than that, when we try to call now, there is no line.
1600880	1602660	You don't reach to anything.
1602900	1604720	It's ringing, but nobody answered.
1605160	1606440	Have you spoken to the police?
1606500	1608140	Have you spoken to people in the army?
1608400	1609020	We try.
1609180	1612560	Even during the library, we call the authorities.
1612940	1619160	And they all say they're aware of the problem and they really don't have something to do right now.
1619260	1623720	It is a chaos. It is really a chaos. It was a chaos. It's still a chaos.
1624160	1631840	People don't know how to manage. It was really a surprise attack. People don't know how to manage the situation.
1632320	1639000	What do you and the rest of the family want the authorities to do when it comes to your aunt, her partner and his children?
1639100	1642920	We want to bring them home safe. No matter what, the people,
1642940	1647580	prices. I think we all, the toll
1647580	1650460	they took from us, we have
1650460	1654480	700 people killed, a thousand of people injured
1654480	1660940	in, not several injuries, like, wounded very hard.
1661740	1664820	It's not supposed to be in the civilians, people.
1665120	1667700	Civilians shouldn't be paying this price.
1667920	1672400	Your family is clearly going through a very worrying, harrowing time at the
1672400	1674020	moment. What is it like
1674020	1676240	being an Israeli right now?
1676380	1677900	It's a bit disappointing.
1678260	1680180	It's a bit hard. It's
1680180	1682560	unknown. You don't know
1682560	1684380	what's going to be tomorrow.
1685080	1686400	Is there a B attack
1686400	1687800	also from Hezbollah?
1688440	1690380	Things are going to cool down.
1690800	1692140	Somebody is going to
1692140	1694080	take care of all the people who
1694080	1696080	got injured, who is
1696080	1698260	not home, who is dead.
1698480	1699740	There is so many
1699740	1701620	questions you need to be asked and
1702780	1703920	I don't know.
1704540	1706840	You feel a lot of things right now in Israel.
1707640	1709320	But we all feel very divided.
1710360	1713960	That was Yadin there, who didn't want us to use her surname
1713960	1719120	talking about her aunt and her partner and their children,
1719220	1722540	including 8-year-old Ella, who they watched being
1722540	1727700	abducted by Hamas Fighters on a Facebook live video on Saturday.
1727700	1731180	We did put her point that the authorities had done very little
1731180	1736000	and her view to the Israeli military spokesperson we had on the program and she said that they
1736000	1742900	would work to try to recover all of the people who had been taken. That is it for this
1742900	1748080	edition of Newsday. More on that continuing situation in the Middle East on the BBC website
