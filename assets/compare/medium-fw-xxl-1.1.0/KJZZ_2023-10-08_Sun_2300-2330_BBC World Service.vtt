00:21.380 --> 00:26.500
This morning we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with

00:26.500 --> 00:31.560
more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza. We hear from a woman in Gaza.

00:31.960 --> 00:37.680
The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

00:38.320 --> 00:43.940
Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with each and every missile very impactful

00:43.940 --> 00:45.120
and damaging.

00:45.840 --> 00:51.240
In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival,

00:51.360 --> 00:53.460
the first site attacked by Hamas.

00:53.460 --> 00:57.680
We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that

00:57.680 --> 01:00.440
has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.580
And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than

01:04.580 --> 01:09.520
2,000 people. Rescue efforts are continuing. But first, we're getting a bulletin of

01:09.520 --> 01:10.060
World News.

01:13.970 --> 01:17.190
This is Danielle Yavavetska with the BBC News. Hello.

01:17.910 --> 01:23.130
The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over

01:23.130 --> 01:28.950
500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip. Operations are continuing against Palestinian

01:28.950 --> 01:34.250
Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel, two days after they carried out

01:34.250 --> 01:38.530
their devastating mass assault. More than 700 Israelis have been killed.

01:38.850 --> 01:40.390
John Donison is in Jerusalem.

01:41.070 --> 01:46.090
The Israeli military says it has continued to target Hamas infrastructure with airstrikes

01:46.090 --> 01:51.950
overnight. The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced,

01:51.950 --> 01:57.410
with many seeking shelter in UN schools. But most believe this is just the beginning.

01:57.990 --> 02:03.170
Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000

02:03.170 --> 02:07.890
army reservists. Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion,

02:08.350 --> 02:13.050
with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in

02:13.050 --> 02:13.370
Gaza.

02:14.050 --> 02:18.390
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far

02:18.390 --> 02:23.670
by Israeli airstrikes. Over 2,000 people have been injured. They said power cuts were

02:23.670 --> 02:28.230
widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical workers. Hamas said it had fired

02:28.230 --> 02:33.090
a new barrage of missiles into Israel. Three US air carriers, as well as Air

02:33.090 --> 02:36.970
France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended flights to Tel Aviv.

02:38.090 --> 02:42.230
The United States says it is sending immediate extra munitions to Israel. The

02:42.230 --> 02:46.410
Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier,

02:46.410 --> 02:50.690
to the eastern Mediterranean. More from Barbara Platasha in Washington.

02:51.330 --> 02:55.450
The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel

02:55.450 --> 02:59.310
and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region. They are sending an aircraft

02:59.310 --> 03:04.250
carrier with a deck of warplanes, accompanied by cruisers and destroyers. Also extra

03:04.250 --> 03:06.310
military assistance, such as munitions.

03:06.590 --> 03:10.870
In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining

03:10.870 --> 03:16.310
the fight. It is backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas. There are reports

03:16.310 --> 03:20.870
that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack, although the Secretary of State

03:20.870 --> 03:24.210
Antony Blinken said the US hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.

03:25.110 --> 03:29.310
The UN Security Council has held an emergency closed-door session to

03:29.310 --> 03:33.950
discuss the crisis. The UN Middle East envoy called on countries to exert

03:33.950 --> 03:38.410
diplomatic efforts to restore calm. More from Nedda Taufik in New York.

03:38.950 --> 03:42.750
Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement. Not all,

03:42.750 --> 03:47.830
but many condemned Hamas. The UAE's ambassador to the UN, Lanin Acebe, told

03:47.830 --> 03:51.890
reporters there was real concern that tensions in the region could become

03:51.890 --> 03:56.170
inflamed. Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan,

03:56.490 --> 04:00.910
showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.

04:01.210 --> 04:05.370
The Palestinian UN ambassador, Riyad Mansour, told reporters he'd

04:05.370 --> 04:09.390
requested an emergency meeting of Arab League states in Cairo.

04:09.390 --> 04:11.390
BBC World News.

04:13.070 --> 04:17.610
An independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into

04:17.610 --> 04:21.570
allegations that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed

04:21.570 --> 04:26.130
civilians, including children in Afghanistan. The inquiry was set up by

04:26.130 --> 04:29.230
the British government after legal action was brought by two Afghan

04:29.230 --> 04:34.270
families. The US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a

04:34.270 --> 04:38.150
bipartisan delegation to China, has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

04:38.670 --> 04:42.070
Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit as

04:42.070 --> 04:47.170
Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing. Regional elections in two

04:47.170 --> 04:51.590
of Germany's largest and wealthiest states, Bavaria and Hesse, have

04:51.590 --> 04:54.750
dealt a blow to the parties that form the centre-left federal

04:54.750 --> 04:58.530
government. Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats,

04:58.710 --> 05:02.470
the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats. The Christian Democrats

05:02.470 --> 05:07.310
again emerge as the largest party. The president of Ecuador has

05:07.310 --> 05:11.310
extended the state of emergency by 30 days. It's been in place since

05:11.310 --> 05:14.710
the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential

05:14.710 --> 05:18.870
candidate Fernando Villavicencio. The extension comes just days

05:18.870 --> 05:21.730
after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were found dead

05:21.730 --> 05:25.630
in prison. A hoard of coins believed to have belonged to a

05:25.630 --> 05:29.070
Highland clan chief, who was murdered more than 300 years ago,

05:29.190 --> 05:32.430
has been found in Scotland. Alexandra McKenzie reports.

05:33.030 --> 05:36.590
The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the

05:36.590 --> 05:40.850
first major excavation in Glencoe. The dig focused on scattered

05:40.850 --> 05:44.130
rocks believed to have been the MacDonald clan chief's

05:44.130 --> 05:47.450
summer house. More than 300 years after he died in the

05:47.450 --> 05:51.330
Glencoe massacre, an archaeology student taking part in her

05:51.330 --> 05:55.310
first ever dig found the hoard. The University of Glasgow said

05:55.310 --> 06:00.030
the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins. A number of

06:00.030 --> 06:03.410
other artifacts were also discovered at the site, including

06:03.410 --> 06:07.890
a musket and fouling shot, pottery from across Europe and a

06:07.890 --> 06:10.750
powder major. BBC News.

06:14.210 --> 06:17.030
Thank you for that bulletin of news. Hello, your Newsday

06:17.030 --> 06:19.750
from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wohonda and Rob

06:19.750 --> 06:21.810
Young. Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue

06:21.810 --> 06:25.290
to focus on the conflict between Israel and Gaza with

06:25.290 --> 06:29.090
voices from both sides and we'll get all your sports and

06:29.090 --> 06:30.230
business headlines too.

06:34.270 --> 06:38.250
We are starting with the latest development in Israel and

06:38.250 --> 06:41.550
Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up

06:41.550 --> 06:45.090
by the hour. The Israeli military says that at least 700

06:45.090 --> 06:48.210
people have died in the attacks overall, with more than

06:48.210 --> 06:53.190
2000 injured. The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies

06:53.190 --> 06:56.410
at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas

06:56.410 --> 06:59.190
militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday

06:59.190 --> 07:00.210
morning. The wake of the attack took place on Saturday

07:00.210 --> 07:02.970
The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group

07:02.970 --> 07:06.310
is being described as the biggest escalation between

07:06.310 --> 07:09.630
the two sides for decades. In retaliation, Israel

07:09.630 --> 07:12.930
launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400

07:12.930 --> 07:16.730
people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2000 wounded,

07:17.070 --> 07:19.690
according to the latest update from the Palestinian

07:19.690 --> 07:23.090
officials. Video images show many buildings being

07:23.090 --> 07:26.210
blown up in large-scale destruction. Shops are

07:26.210 --> 07:29.130
closed. The streets are empty. The city is said to

07:29.130 --> 07:32.670
be like a ghost town. According to the United Nations,

07:33.230 --> 07:37.490
123,000 Palestinians have now been displaced in Gaza

07:37.490 --> 07:40.530
because of the airstrikes. And many Palestinians say

07:40.530 --> 07:43.490
they are now living in fear of their lives. In the

07:43.490 --> 07:45.890
last hour, we got this voice note from a resident

07:45.890 --> 07:49.550
in Gaza. The last couple of days were harrowing

07:49.550 --> 07:54.190
and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge. Gaza

07:54.190 --> 07:58.210
is a very highly dense populated area with very

07:58.210 --> 08:02.990
limited geographical area, like with over 2 million

08:02.990 --> 08:09.090
people living in 360 km2, which make it each

08:09.090 --> 08:12.610
and every missile dropped very impactful and damaging.

08:13.570 --> 08:16.950
The offensive launched from Gaza can only be

08:16.950 --> 08:20.730
understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing

08:20.730 --> 08:24.310
decades-long military occupation and settler

08:24.310 --> 08:27.730
colonization of Palestinian land and the

08:27.730 --> 08:31.590
composition of a system of oppression that meets

08:31.590 --> 08:35.390
the legal definition of apartheid. Meanwhile,

08:35.650 --> 08:38.850
Israeli also has maintained a brutal placate

08:38.850 --> 08:44.370
on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians

08:47.010 --> 08:51.110
refusing its population access to basic supplies

08:51.110 --> 08:56.170
and material needs to survive and trapping them

08:56.170 --> 09:02.030
in amounts to an open air prison with restrictions

09:02.030 --> 09:04.810
on right to movement, right to help and many

09:04.810 --> 09:09.210
other associated basic rights. Yet we were told

09:09.210 --> 09:12.470
as civilians to leave. I mean, leave and go

09:12.470 --> 09:16.730
where? No crossings are open, neither the

09:16.730 --> 09:19.710
sea that is also have restriction to some point.

09:20.410 --> 09:23.390
If you trespass, you can be shot. For the

09:23.390 --> 09:26.610
past few days, hundreds of Palestinians were

09:26.610 --> 09:29.070
killed, including women, children, elderly,

09:29.450 --> 09:32.510
and persons with disabilities. I mean,

09:32.650 --> 09:35.390
thousands of people are internally displaced

09:35.390 --> 09:39.830
to school shelters that not even fully prepared

09:39.830 --> 09:42.570
or equipped to accommodate these numbers and

09:42.570 --> 09:46.750
provide for their needs. I mean, Israel has

09:46.750 --> 09:48.850
to adhere to the international humanitarian

09:48.850 --> 09:51.990
laws in conflict and its principles. These

09:51.990 --> 09:54.710
principles require Israel to respect the

09:54.710 --> 09:57.950
distinction between competence and civilians,

09:59.210 --> 10:06.650
avoid disproportionate use of force, and have

10:07.390 --> 10:11.350
responsibility for the humanitarian supplies

10:11.350 --> 10:17.150
for the population. And now there is limited

10:19.930 --> 10:24.330
electricity and crossings are fully closed to

10:24.330 --> 10:28.650
let in any supplies. But in ground, all that

10:28.650 --> 10:31.730
is happening are against these principles. And

10:31.730 --> 10:33.850
the international community has to play a

10:33.850 --> 10:36.930
role in ending this bloodshed and killing

10:36.930 --> 10:41.150
of civilians. A resident in Gaza there about

10:41.150 --> 10:43.790
what the last couple of days have been like.

10:43.790 --> 10:45.690
And if you want to keep up to date with

10:45.690 --> 10:48.630
the latest, just go to bbc.com forward slash

10:48.630 --> 10:51.330
news. There is a live page of being updated

10:51.330 --> 10:53.450
as we get more news. Well, we're going to

10:53.450 --> 10:56.270
head to Israel and speak to the country's

10:56.270 --> 10:58.790
special envoy for combating anti-Semitism,

10:59.070 --> 11:01.530
a former member of the Knesset, the Israeli

11:01.530 --> 11:03.790
Parliament, Mikhal Kotlov. Thanks so much

11:03.790 --> 11:08.810
for joining us. How are Israelis feeling

11:08.810 --> 11:13.570
today? You know, I think that what you just

11:13.570 --> 11:16.610
actually framed as how Israelis are feeling

11:17.490 --> 11:20.270
is... it actually encourages me to ask you

11:20.270 --> 11:22.950
the question. Because, you know, when I

11:22.950 --> 11:25.470
hear the framing of what is happening in

11:25.470 --> 11:28.850
Israel, where a genocidal terror organization

11:28.850 --> 11:32.050
holding two million civilians in Gaza

11:32.050 --> 11:35.130
alongside all those civilians in Israel

11:35.130 --> 11:37.690
that were targeted on Saturday morning as

11:37.690 --> 11:40.930
we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath

11:40.930 --> 11:44.550
morning and a holiday in Israel, 5,000

11:44.550 --> 11:46.990
rockets launched at Israeli civilians

11:46.990 --> 11:49.670
from densely populated areas in Gaza,

11:50.070 --> 11:52.690
each rocket a double war crime and a

11:52.690 --> 11:54.450
violation of international humanitarian

11:54.450 --> 11:56.670
law. When I think of the massacre

11:56.670 --> 11:59.270
targeting Jews that indiscriminately

11:59.270 --> 12:04.710
shot 260, at least, young party-goers

12:04.710 --> 12:07.170
on that very day of the holiday, when I

12:07.170 --> 12:10.670
think of the anti-Semitic terror

12:10.670 --> 12:14.410
organization, Hamas, actually designated

12:14.410 --> 12:16.950
as a terror organization, funded and

12:16.950 --> 12:19.770
supported by a genocidal regime in Iran,

12:20.290 --> 12:25.210
holding its own civilians in Iran

12:25.210 --> 12:27.530
in the same way that Gaza, in the

12:27.530 --> 12:28.970
same way that ISIS, in the same way

12:28.970 --> 12:31.750
that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the

12:31.750 --> 12:34.750
West, that genocidal terror cannot be

12:34.750 --> 12:36.930
allowed to dictate the way that

12:36.930 --> 12:39.310
sovereign democratic countries conduct

12:39.310 --> 12:41.230
ourselves. So I would turn the question

12:41.230 --> 12:43.370
to you, if this were happening anywhere

12:43.370 --> 12:45.430
else in the world, not only for

12:45.430 --> 12:47.810
Israel's right to defend its

12:47.810 --> 12:49.570
civilians, but Israel's, indeed,

12:49.890 --> 12:51.630
responsibility to defend its

12:51.630 --> 12:53.530
civilians, where the majority of those

12:53.530 --> 12:58.190
targeted over the last 48 hours are,

12:58.190 --> 13:03.090
indeed, civilians and holding

13:03.090 --> 13:06.170
families of Holocaust survivors being

13:06.170 --> 13:08.550
abducted into the Gaza Strip of

13:08.550 --> 13:10.210
Israel, their entire families being

13:10.210 --> 13:14.030
butchered in their homes, and to hear

13:14.030 --> 13:16.790
the way that the framing that BBC

13:17.550 --> 13:19.790
enables this situation is actually

13:19.790 --> 13:21.530
part and parcel of what enables

13:21.530 --> 13:24.430
genocidal terror to control and to

13:24.430 --> 13:25.830
continue to dictate the discourse.

13:25.950 --> 13:27.210
Well, I think you'll find that

13:27.210 --> 13:30.010
we're talking to as many different

13:30.550 --> 13:33.130
people with as many perspectives on

13:33.130 --> 13:34.790
this as we can. I asked you how

13:34.790 --> 13:36.790
Israelis were feeling, and I got a

13:36.790 --> 13:40.210
sense from you of the anger there is

13:40.210 --> 13:42.150
and the sadness, too. No, there is no

13:42.150 --> 13:43.930
anger. We are fighting for our lives.

13:44.070 --> 13:46.290
There is no anger. Let it be clear.

13:47.010 --> 13:49.450
You said that this is like

13:49.450 --> 13:52.630
Israel's 9-11. Is that because of

13:52.630 --> 13:54.350
the shock that this was able to

13:54.350 --> 13:56.650
happen? It's not just because of

13:56.650 --> 13:58.630
this shock. It's because of the same

13:58.630 --> 14:01.730
modus operandi. This is a terror

14:01.730 --> 14:04.510
organization listed as such in most of

14:04.510 --> 14:06.090
the countries that are listening to us

14:06.090 --> 14:09.010
at the moment. Terror is not a moral

14:09.010 --> 14:10.950
equivalency to a sovereign country

14:10.950 --> 14:13.130
that must defend its citizens from

14:13.130 --> 14:16.050
terror. You cannot speak about both

14:16.050 --> 14:18.070
sides if you actually want to

14:18.070 --> 14:20.070
understand what Israelis are feeling.

14:20.310 --> 14:22.350
There is no both sides. When a

14:22.350 --> 14:25.810
terror organization ravages civilian

14:25.810 --> 14:28.990
areas, enters under the guise of

14:28.990 --> 14:31.030
5,000 rockets targeting those

14:31.030 --> 14:33.850
civilians, breaking barriers, that

14:33.850 --> 14:35.690
there is a fence. There has not been

14:35.690 --> 14:38.690
any occupation of Gaza since 2005.

14:39.810 --> 14:41.090
There has been a blockade, though,

14:41.110 --> 14:42.690
hasn't there, of Gaza? No. No, there

14:42.690 --> 14:44.690
is no blockade because there are

14:44.690 --> 14:46.730
thousands, thousands of workers

14:46.730 --> 14:49.290
entering Gaza every day to work in

14:49.290 --> 14:51.530
Israel. There are thousands of

14:51.530 --> 14:53.630
truckloads. There is electricity and

14:53.630 --> 14:55.310
water still being supplied, although

14:55.310 --> 14:57.770
Hamas has responsibility for the

14:57.770 --> 14:59.670
civilians in Gaza, because that's who

14:59.670 --> 15:03.030
was elected to reign over Gaza. And

15:03.030 --> 15:04.470
there is a responsibility of the

15:04.470 --> 15:06.450
international community and of all

15:06.450 --> 15:07.870
those that cherish life and liberty

15:07.870 --> 15:10.010
to hold Hamas to account for holding

15:10.010 --> 15:13.030
those 2 million civilians in Gaza

15:13.030 --> 15:15.490
hostage to their war crimes, not

15:15.490 --> 15:17.170
only on Israel but on Gaza's

15:17.770 --> 15:18.710
civilians. How do you think the

15:18.710 --> 15:20.270
Israeli military should respond then?

15:20.410 --> 15:24.390
We've seen more than 500 airstrikes

15:24.390 --> 15:25.550
over the weekend. How do you think

15:25.550 --> 15:26.950
the Israeli military should respond?

15:27.610 --> 15:29.570
Well, my job is to ask questions, not

15:29.570 --> 15:31.530
answer them. Well, I'm wondering what

15:31.530 --> 15:33.270
you think any country must do in order

15:33.270 --> 15:34.650
to protect its civilians when they're

15:34.650 --> 15:36.710
being attacked, including as we speak

15:36.710 --> 15:39.950
in their homes, including as we speak.

15:39.990 --> 15:42.070
There is an ongoing war here with

15:42.070 --> 15:44.610
genocidal terror. This is not two

15:44.610 --> 15:46.630
countries fighting each other. A

15:46.630 --> 15:48.550
genocidal terror organization, ISIS,

15:48.730 --> 15:51.670
if you will, 9-11, needs moral

15:51.670 --> 15:53.990
clarity. And this is not just about

15:53.990 --> 15:55.910
Jews around the world who are now

15:55.910 --> 15:57.510
under attack. So to my question, how

15:57.510 --> 15:58.550
do you think the military should

15:58.550 --> 15:59.950
respond? There's been speculation

15:59.950 --> 16:02.070
that there might be a ground invasion

16:02.070 --> 16:04.730
of Gaza, although we're told there are

16:04.730 --> 16:09.330
dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza

16:09.330 --> 16:11.210
at the moment. Do you think a

16:11.210 --> 16:13.030
ground invasion is the way for the

16:13.030 --> 16:14.170
Israeli government to go?

16:14.970 --> 16:16.770
There are dozens of Israeli

16:16.770 --> 16:18.950
hostages, and many of them are

16:18.950 --> 16:21.230
civilians that were abducted, many

16:21.230 --> 16:23.770
of them raped, many of them paraded

16:23.770 --> 16:25.710
around the streets of Gaza and

16:25.710 --> 16:29.650
celebrated. And the Israeli IDF will

16:29.650 --> 16:31.690
do everything that it needs to do to

16:31.690 --> 16:34.290
protect as it must the citizens of

16:34.290 --> 16:36.170
the state of Israel under attack as

16:36.170 --> 16:39.830
we speak. And every country that

16:39.830 --> 16:42.890
cherishes life and liberty must

16:42.890 --> 16:46.010
protect its citizens from an ongoing

16:47.010 --> 16:49.130
onslaught massacre of its

16:49.130 --> 16:51.130
civilians. And those hostages that

16:51.130 --> 16:52.950
have been held are being held by a

16:52.950 --> 16:54.270
genocidal terror organization. And I

16:54.270 --> 16:56.390
want to make it very clear, alongside

16:56.390 --> 16:58.690
two Israeli deceased soldiers and

16:58.690 --> 17:00.230
two civilians that have been held by

17:00.230 --> 17:02.170
the same genocidal terror organization

17:02.170 --> 17:05.070
in a nine-year standing violation of

17:05.070 --> 17:06.650
international law and human rights.

17:07.070 --> 17:09.210
And each one of those civilians and

17:09.210 --> 17:11.050
every one of our countries must call

17:11.050 --> 17:12.810
for the immediate and unconditional

17:12.810 --> 17:14.910
return, because it is countries

17:14.910 --> 17:17.870
supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas,

17:18.430 --> 17:20.730
a genocidal terror organization, to

17:20.730 --> 17:23.330
hold those civilians hostage as we

17:23.330 --> 17:25.330
speak. And what the IDF will have

17:25.330 --> 17:26.710
to do and the state of Israel will

17:26.710 --> 17:28.950
have to do in its existential war is

17:28.950 --> 17:30.490
not just about the state of Israel.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.030
I want to make it very clear to your

17:32.030 --> 17:32.450
listeners.

17:33.190 --> 17:34.410
Michal Kotler-Wunsch, we've got to

17:34.410 --> 17:35.710
leave it there. Thanks for joining us.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.510
Well, same with this story and

17:38.510 --> 17:40.150
looking at the business side of

17:40.150 --> 17:41.870
things. One industry that's already

17:41.870 --> 17:44.390
filling the impact of this conflict

17:44.390 --> 17:46.370
is the aviation industry, with

17:46.370 --> 17:48.350
dozens of flights already canceled.

17:48.770 --> 17:50.270
Let's get the details with our

17:50.270 --> 17:52.150
business correspondent in Singapore,

17:52.510 --> 17:54.250
Katie Silva. Katie, what are we

17:54.250 --> 17:54.570
seeing?

17:55.670 --> 17:57.530
Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many

17:57.530 --> 17:59.350
airlines canceling flights. The likes,

17:59.450 --> 18:01.410
for example, of American Airlines, Air

18:01.410 --> 18:03.470
France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryan

18:03.470 --> 18:05.590
Air all canceled journeys. British

18:05.590 --> 18:07.410
Airways, for its part, told the BBC

18:07.410 --> 18:09.230
that it's only canceled one flight

18:09.230 --> 18:11.470
on Sunday and that it's going to be

18:11.470 --> 18:13.310
adjusting departure times for flights

18:13.310 --> 18:14.350
in the coming days. And that's

18:14.350 --> 18:15.790
unclear if that's because of

18:16.210 --> 18:17.750
disruption at the airport or if

18:17.750 --> 18:19.510
perhaps they want to land at

18:19.510 --> 18:20.610
different times of the day that may

18:20.610 --> 18:22.670
be deemed safer. Many of these

18:22.670 --> 18:23.790
airlines are also offering

18:24.490 --> 18:26.410
passengers to cancel their flights

18:26.410 --> 18:28.630
or to move the dates with no

18:28.630 --> 18:29.630
sort of change fees.

18:30.590 --> 18:32.310
Flights to Israel's second international

18:32.310 --> 18:34.330
airport, Eliat, which is a tourist

18:34.330 --> 18:35.350
destination on the Red Sea, they've

18:35.350 --> 18:37.090
been unaffected. But we've also heard

18:37.090 --> 18:39.410
that Israel's flag carrier, El Al,

18:39.590 --> 18:40.570
it's said that it's going to be

18:40.570 --> 18:42.130
maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv

18:42.130 --> 18:44.590
for now, but again allowing airlines

18:44.590 --> 18:47.250
and passengers to change their

18:47.250 --> 18:48.850
flights. But Katie, this also

18:48.850 --> 18:50.350
comes at the same time as many

18:50.350 --> 18:52.550
Israelis are trying or desperately

18:52.550 --> 18:53.790
trying to leave.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.210
Oh, to leave as well as to get

18:57.210 --> 18:58.330
home. So that's one of the major

18:58.330 --> 18:59.770
issues is that many have found

18:59.770 --> 19:01.690
themselves stranded and with fears

19:01.690 --> 19:04.190
about whether or not the

19:04.190 --> 19:05.810
airspace will be closed.

19:06.190 --> 19:07.530
So one of our reporters, for example,

19:07.530 --> 19:09.250
was actually there amongst them

19:09.250 --> 19:10.990
stranded in Cyprus, at Lanica

19:10.990 --> 19:13.050
International Airport late last night.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.230
Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of

19:15.230 --> 19:16.730
Israelis hoping to get one of the

19:16.730 --> 19:18.710
last flights home. As I say,

19:18.710 --> 19:20.270
there are still rumours about whether or not

19:20.270 --> 19:22.050
the country may close its airspace.

19:22.390 --> 19:24.050
It was hard to get tickets, we understand.

19:24.210 --> 19:26.030
Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for

19:26.030 --> 19:27.570
example, for no shows on the fully

19:27.570 --> 19:29.670
booked flights and getting back into the

19:29.670 --> 19:31.230
country certainly hasn't been easy.

19:31.610 --> 19:33.610
In terms of leaving the country, we've heard, for example,

19:33.750 --> 19:35.750
as well from Athens, the foreign

19:35.750 --> 19:38.150
ministry saying that it's working to repatriate

19:38.150 --> 19:40.110
about 149 Greek tourists

19:40.110 --> 19:41.990
from Israel. Some of them were

19:41.990 --> 19:43.930
due to arrive back late last night

19:43.930 --> 19:46.710
into Greece. But there is

19:46.710 --> 19:48.850
concern about many of the foreign

19:48.850 --> 19:50.790
workers in Israel. I know, for example, Thailand

19:50.790 --> 19:52.850
has about 30,000 workers

19:52.850 --> 19:54.750
in Israel and so governments around

19:54.750 --> 19:56.690
the world looking at how they can get their citizens home

19:56.690 --> 19:58.290
if indeed they want to leave Israel.

19:59.290 --> 20:00.750
Alright, Katie Silva, always a pleasure

20:00.750 --> 20:02.670
to have you on the program, our business

20:02.670 --> 20:04.450
correspondent there in Singapore.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.750
And we are remaining with this

20:06.750 --> 20:08.570
story and we are now going to speak to

20:08.570 --> 20:11.070
our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.

20:11.130 --> 20:12.410
Good morning to you, Jeremy.

20:12.510 --> 20:15.010
Now, you have called this a major

20:15.010 --> 20:17.570
Middle East crisis. Can you elaborate

20:17.570 --> 20:18.930
that for us, please, if you may?

20:20.170 --> 20:21.150
Well, it's

20:21.150 --> 20:22.990
unprecedented that

20:22.990 --> 20:24.550
the Palestinian

20:24.550 --> 20:27.250
armed group, Hamas, has

20:27.250 --> 20:29.390
been able to break out of Gaza,

20:29.570 --> 20:31.190
which is surrounded

20:31.190 --> 20:33.010
by, if you like, a ring of steel,

20:33.290 --> 20:35.200
of fences, wire fences and concrete,

20:36.090 --> 20:36.990
break out

20:36.990 --> 20:39.230
and kill huge

20:39.230 --> 20:40.950
numbers of Israelis,

20:41.050 --> 20:42.890
including many, many civilians.

20:42.890 --> 20:44.670
That kind of thing

20:44.670 --> 20:47.090
is something that Israel hasn't experienced

20:47.090 --> 20:48.790
before and

20:48.790 --> 20:50.450
it's becoming

20:50.450 --> 20:52.690
clear that it's a national

20:52.690 --> 20:55.330
trauma and plenty of people here

20:55.330 --> 20:56.870
compare it to the 9-11

20:56.870 --> 20:58.730
attacks in the United States.

20:59.150 --> 21:01.010
There's even one article

21:01.010 --> 21:02.630
in one of the newspapers here saying that

21:02.630 --> 21:05.010
if you adjust the death toll for population

21:05.010 --> 21:06.770
it's the equivalent of the Americans

21:06.770 --> 21:08.790
losing more than 20,000

21:08.790 --> 21:11.110
on 9-11. So, it's

21:11.110 --> 21:13.470
a big, big event

21:13.470 --> 21:15.350
and the Israeli response,

21:15.370 --> 21:17.430
which is going to be, is already

21:17.430 --> 21:19.070
very heavy military action,

21:19.330 --> 21:21.270
but they think there will be a

21:21.270 --> 21:22.690
land invasion, too, of Gaza.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.250
Now, that also is something

21:25.250 --> 21:27.350
that could have reverberations right

21:27.350 --> 21:29.110
across the region. So,

21:29.210 --> 21:31.170
we're into really unexplored

21:31.170 --> 21:32.190
territory right now.

21:33.550 --> 21:35.190
And, Jeremy, you have been in

21:35.190 --> 21:36.790
the region, you have been in the area.

21:36.910 --> 21:39.270
Just for our listeners' benefit, can you

21:39.270 --> 21:41.410
describe what Gaza Strip looks like

21:41.410 --> 21:43.210
and how that area is to

21:43.210 --> 21:43.910
Israel?

21:46.630 --> 21:47.450
Gaza is

21:47.450 --> 21:49.410
a narrow strip of land

21:49.830 --> 21:51.430
along the Mediterranean

21:51.430 --> 21:53.630
coast, which is surrounded

21:53.630 --> 21:55.150
mostly by Israel,

21:55.630 --> 21:57.370
but with

21:57.370 --> 21:59.230
a narrow border

21:59.230 --> 22:01.090
which also goes into

22:01.090 --> 22:01.690
Egypt.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.210
The Palestinian

22:05.210 --> 22:07.610
population of Gaza is around 2.4

22:07.610 --> 22:09.190
million people,

22:09.490 --> 22:11.610
many of them are descendants of

22:12.190 --> 22:13.590
families who lost their

22:13.590 --> 22:15.510
homes when Israel was created

22:15.510 --> 22:17.130
in 1948,

22:17.510 --> 22:19.750
a time that the Palestinians call the Nakba,

22:20.070 --> 22:20.990
the catastrophe.

22:22.070 --> 22:23.850
And it's an area where people

22:23.850 --> 22:25.370
are mostly very poor,

22:25.490 --> 22:27.550
they live in very difficult and

22:27.550 --> 22:29.630
cramped conditions, they're

22:29.630 --> 22:31.830
mostly not allowed to leave the area.

22:32.330 --> 22:33.610
There are plenty of

22:33.610 --> 22:35.850
adults there who've never left.

22:35.850 --> 22:37.350
And so

22:37.350 --> 22:39.770
it is a situation

22:40.490 --> 22:41.910
which is... life

22:41.910 --> 22:44.230
there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic

22:44.230 --> 22:45.890
and since 2007

22:45.890 --> 22:48.050
it's been controlled by the Palestinian

22:48.470 --> 22:49.970
militant group, Hamas,

22:50.070 --> 22:52.010
which is an Arabic acronym

22:52.010 --> 22:53.730
for the Islamic resistance movement.

22:54.450 --> 22:55.850
And you wrote a

22:56.510 --> 22:57.930
nice read on our website

22:57.930 --> 22:59.550
where you said that, you know, Hamas

22:59.550 --> 23:01.890
blindsided Israel with what you

23:01.890 --> 23:03.850
call the most serious attack in a

23:03.850 --> 23:06.170
generation. And we're hearing stories

23:06.170 --> 23:07.870
of hostages that have been taken

23:07.870 --> 23:10.130
including civilians as well as soldiers.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.110
What sort of challenge does

23:12.110 --> 23:13.930
this pose for the government of Mr.

23:14.030 --> 23:15.970
Netanyahu and the army going forward?

23:17.110 --> 23:18.230
It's the most profound

23:18.230 --> 23:19.990
challenge that any Israel government

23:19.990 --> 23:21.810
has, I think, faced probably

23:21.810 --> 23:23.910
for 50 years since

23:23.910 --> 23:26.050
the 1973 Middle East War.

23:27.850 --> 23:30.070
He is... his political enemies

23:30.070 --> 23:31.910
are already blaming him, saying

23:31.910 --> 23:34.390
that he took his arm off the ball

23:34.390 --> 23:36.110
for a variety of reasons.

23:36.850 --> 23:37.910
It's clear that there's

23:37.910 --> 23:40.010
been, from the Israeli perspective, a huge

23:40.010 --> 23:41.150
intelligence failure.

23:41.730 --> 23:44.010
And they're struggling militarily to assert

23:44.010 --> 23:45.990
themselves. They will succeed in

23:45.990 --> 23:47.770
doing that, I'm pretty certain,

23:47.790 --> 23:49.730
because Israel has got very powerful

23:49.730 --> 23:52.030
armed forces. I think the big

23:52.030 --> 23:54.130
question, which was

23:54.130 --> 23:55.610
and this is

23:56.390 --> 23:58.090
probably an equal challenge

23:58.090 --> 23:59.470
for the Israelis,

23:59.470 --> 24:02.250
is what happens after that?

24:02.430 --> 24:03.470
How do they...

24:04.450 --> 24:05.590
what happens in Gaza

24:05.590 --> 24:07.490
on the day that they leave?

24:07.570 --> 24:09.690
Because the Israelis, who used to

24:09.690 --> 24:11.490
occupy Gaza, and

24:11.490 --> 24:13.470
finally pulled out in 2005,

24:15.450 --> 24:17.690
do not want to get back into a full scale

24:17.690 --> 24:19.790
occupation. But if they send in their troops,

24:20.530 --> 24:21.650
there's going to have to be

24:21.650 --> 24:22.930
some kind of governance

24:23.430 --> 24:25.670
of a territory, which is maybe

24:25.670 --> 24:27.010
small, but as I said,

24:28.310 --> 24:29.290
contains getting on

24:29.290 --> 24:30.830
for two and a half million people.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.110
Jeremy Bowen there,

24:33.150 --> 24:35.150
thank you for coming on the programme. He is our

24:35.150 --> 24:36.370
international editor.

24:43.410 --> 24:44.570
We're going to move away from our top

24:44.570 --> 24:46.510
story. We will return to it later on in the programme

24:46.510 --> 24:48.430
though. Isaac Fanon is here. He's going to give us

24:48.430 --> 24:50.450
some sports headlines. Yeah, took Arsenal 12

24:50.450 --> 24:52.590
goals, but they finally beat Manchester

24:52.590 --> 24:54.250
City in the Premier League. Gabriel

24:54.250 --> 24:56.330
Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th

24:56.330 --> 24:58.430
minute as City lost their second game

24:58.430 --> 25:00.850
in the Premier League in a row for the first

25:00.850 --> 25:02.830
time. That's happened in five years.

25:03.390 --> 25:04.590
European football's governing body

25:04.590 --> 25:06.750
UEFA has postponed all matches scheduled

25:06.750 --> 25:08.530
in Israel during the next fortnight

25:08.990 --> 25:10.710
amid increased tensions in the

25:10.710 --> 25:12.490
region. Israel were due to play

25:12.490 --> 25:14.510
Switzerland in a Euro 2024

25:14.510 --> 25:16.630
qualifier in Tel Aviv, but that

25:16.630 --> 25:18.510
game has been rescheduled and UEFA said

25:18.510 --> 25:20.510
it will assess the situation over

25:20.510 --> 25:22.750
the coming days to see whether Israel's

25:22.750 --> 25:24.890
away qualifier in Kosovo

25:24.890 --> 25:26.670
will still take place on the 15th

25:26.670 --> 25:28.770
of October. To athletics news

25:28.770 --> 25:30.650
next, Kenyan Kelvin Kipton

25:30.650 --> 25:32.730
shattered the men's marathon world

25:32.730 --> 25:34.390
record in Chicago. He beat

25:34.390 --> 25:36.970
his compatriot Eli Kipchoge's previous

25:36.970 --> 25:38.870
match by more than 30 seconds.

25:39.350 --> 25:40.770
The 23-year-old finished in a

25:40.770 --> 25:42.650
time of two hours, 35

25:42.650 --> 25:44.690
seconds. And Australia are out

25:44.690 --> 25:46.490
of the Rugby World Cup despite

25:46.490 --> 25:48.730
Fiji losing 24-23 to

25:48.730 --> 25:50.810
Portugal in the final pool stage

25:50.810 --> 25:52.630
match. Fiji got a losing bonus

25:52.630 --> 25:54.910
point and they qualify at Australia's

25:54.910 --> 25:57.150
expense due to their 22-15

25:57.150 --> 25:58.830
victory way back in

25:58.830 --> 26:00.850
September. Isaac, thank you very much

26:00.850 --> 26:02.890
indeed. Now we are

26:02.890 --> 26:04.930
going to turn to

26:04.930 --> 26:06.930
Afghanistan because thousands of people

26:06.930 --> 26:08.550
in the west of the country

26:08.550 --> 26:10.790
are spending a second night in the

26:10.790 --> 26:12.810
open after a strong earthquake on

26:12.810 --> 26:14.710
Saturday reduced entire villages

26:14.710 --> 26:16.810
to rubble. There's been confusion about

26:16.810 --> 26:18.430
the number of dead with Taliban

26:18.430 --> 26:20.590
officials apologising for an early

26:20.590 --> 26:22.930
assessment that more than 2,000

26:22.930 --> 26:25.070
people had died. The United Nations

26:25.070 --> 26:27.050
humanitarian agency says that

26:27.050 --> 26:28.950
more than 1,000 have been

26:28.950 --> 26:30.850
killed and more than 500 are

26:30.850 --> 26:32.790
still missing. I'm now joined

26:32.790 --> 26:34.950
by my colleague from the Afghan

26:34.950 --> 26:37.050
service, Angela Gehr. Good morning

26:37.050 --> 26:39.070
to you, Angela. What is the latest

26:39.070 --> 26:40.610
that you can tell us about this

26:40.610 --> 26:41.810
devastating event?

26:42.930 --> 26:44.370
Good morning.

26:45.810 --> 26:46.950
The news I'm

26:47.530 --> 26:48.950
receiving from Afghanistan

26:48.950 --> 26:51.230
is actually

26:51.230 --> 26:53.410
I can say that is a very,

26:53.410 --> 26:55.230
very, very big...

26:59.810 --> 27:00.970
the darkest

27:00.970 --> 27:03.710
time that we are experiencing

27:03.710 --> 27:05.710
in Afghanistan. The number

27:05.710 --> 27:07.590
that the Taliban

27:07.590 --> 27:09.230
are trying to

27:09.930 --> 27:11.230
share with the media

27:11.230 --> 27:13.230
is very different what we

27:14.190 --> 27:15.190
have receiving

27:15.190 --> 27:17.630
from the people. I think

27:17.630 --> 27:19.150
in that area

27:19.150 --> 27:21.310
we have, we had

27:21.310 --> 27:23.270
more than 20

27:23.270 --> 27:25.250
violets which are

27:25.250 --> 27:26.730
completely destroyed

27:28.170 --> 27:29.610
in the

27:30.090 --> 27:30.990
earthquake.

27:31.710 --> 27:33.330
And also there

27:33.330 --> 27:35.330
is no way for the

27:35.330 --> 27:36.910
actually in the first hour

27:36.910 --> 27:39.270
the Taliban tried to control the medias.

27:39.830 --> 27:41.370
We didn't receive the

27:41.370 --> 27:43.230
actually we thought that everything

27:43.230 --> 27:45.010
is not that

27:45.010 --> 27:47.190
bad what

27:48.210 --> 27:48.810
we

27:48.810 --> 27:51.370
when we

27:51.370 --> 27:53.630
sent the volunteers

27:53.630 --> 27:55.070
group to the area.

27:56.710 --> 27:57.310
Actually

27:57.310 --> 27:58.310
I'm so sorry.

27:59.190 --> 28:01.490
No, don't worry. And so Angela, basically

28:01.490 --> 28:03.430
the Taliban have gone

28:03.430 --> 28:05.410
back to what they said. The numbers have changed.

28:05.590 --> 28:07.170
But what are people saying

28:07.170 --> 28:09.390
on the ground, those who have been affected?

28:11.590 --> 28:12.790
They don't

28:12.790 --> 28:15.030
accept the numbers which

28:15.030 --> 28:16.530
the Taliban is shedding.

28:17.370 --> 28:19.270
Actually, and also

28:19.830 --> 28:21.130
I think more

28:21.130 --> 28:23.510
than 2,000 people are killed.

28:24.210 --> 28:25.350
A thousand people

28:25.350 --> 28:26.250
displaced.

28:27.430 --> 28:28.930
A thousand people are

28:28.930 --> 28:31.010
missing in this

28:31.010 --> 28:32.410
crisis.

28:33.330 --> 28:35.270
And we have

28:35.270 --> 28:36.930
nothing at that moment.

28:37.370 --> 28:39.270
At this moment there are

28:39.270 --> 28:40.990
no big

28:40.990 --> 28:43.210
offer or support from

28:43.210 --> 28:45.890
the Taliban for the people.

28:47.050 --> 28:48.170
Just the

28:48.170 --> 28:49.210
Red Cross and

28:50.930 --> 28:52.050
MSF provided

28:52.050 --> 28:54.070
some help for the people

28:54.070 --> 28:55.890
and the volunteers

28:55.890 --> 28:56.990
group from

28:56.990 --> 28:58.470
other cities.

28:58.850 --> 29:02.070
Thank you so much for coming on to the program, telling us about the

29:02.070 --> 29:04.050
devastating earthquake that has shaken

29:04.050 --> 29:05.890
Afghanistan in the west of the country.

29:05.990 --> 29:08.030
This is Newsday on the BBC World Service
