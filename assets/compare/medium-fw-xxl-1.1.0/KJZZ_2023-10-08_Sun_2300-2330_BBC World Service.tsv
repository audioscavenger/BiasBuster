21380	26500	This morning we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with
26500	31560	more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza. We hear from a woman in Gaza.
31960	37680	The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.
38320	43940	Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with each and every missile very impactful
43940	45120	and damaging.
45840	51240	In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival,
51360	53460	the first site attacked by Hamas.
53460	57680	We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that
57680	60440	has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.
60800	64580	And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than
64580	69520	2,000 people. Rescue efforts are continuing. But first, we're getting a bulletin of
69520	70060	World News.
73970	77190	This is Danielle Yavavetska with the BBC News. Hello.
77910	83130	The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over
83130	88950	500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip. Operations are continuing against Palestinian
88950	94250	Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel, two days after they carried out
94250	98530	their devastating mass assault. More than 700 Israelis have been killed.
98850	100390	John Donison is in Jerusalem.
101070	106090	The Israeli military says it has continued to target Hamas infrastructure with airstrikes
106090	111950	overnight. The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced,
111950	117410	with many seeking shelter in UN schools. But most believe this is just the beginning.
117990	123170	Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000
123170	127890	army reservists. Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion,
128350	133050	with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in
133050	133370	Gaza.
134050	138390	Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far
138390	143670	by Israeli airstrikes. Over 2,000 people have been injured. They said power cuts were
143670	148230	widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical workers. Hamas said it had fired
148230	153090	a new barrage of missiles into Israel. Three US air carriers, as well as Air
153090	156970	France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended flights to Tel Aviv.
158090	162230	The United States says it is sending immediate extra munitions to Israel. The
162230	166410	Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier,
166410	170690	to the eastern Mediterranean. More from Barbara Platasha in Washington.
171330	175450	The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel
175450	179310	and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region. They are sending an aircraft
179310	184250	carrier with a deck of warplanes, accompanied by cruisers and destroyers. Also extra
184250	186310	military assistance, such as munitions.
186590	190870	In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining
190870	196310	the fight. It is backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas. There are reports
196310	200870	that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack, although the Secretary of State
200870	204210	Antony Blinken said the US hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.
205110	209310	The UN Security Council has held an emergency closed-door session to
209310	213950	discuss the crisis. The UN Middle East envoy called on countries to exert
213950	218410	diplomatic efforts to restore calm. More from Nedda Taufik in New York.
218950	222750	Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement. Not all,
222750	227830	but many condemned Hamas. The UAE's ambassador to the UN, Lanin Acebe, told
227830	231890	reporters there was real concern that tensions in the region could become
231890	236170	inflamed. Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan,
236490	240910	showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.
241210	245370	The Palestinian UN ambassador, Riyad Mansour, told reporters he'd
245370	249390	requested an emergency meeting of Arab League states in Cairo.
249390	251390	BBC World News.
253070	257610	An independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into
257610	261570	allegations that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed
261570	266130	civilians, including children in Afghanistan. The inquiry was set up by
266130	269230	the British government after legal action was brought by two Afghan
269230	274270	families. The US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a
274270	278150	bipartisan delegation to China, has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
278670	282070	Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit as
282070	287170	Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing. Regional elections in two
287170	291590	of Germany's largest and wealthiest states, Bavaria and Hesse, have
291590	294750	dealt a blow to the parties that form the centre-left federal
294750	298530	government. Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats,
298710	302470	the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats. The Christian Democrats
302470	307310	again emerge as the largest party. The president of Ecuador has
307310	311310	extended the state of emergency by 30 days. It's been in place since
311310	314710	the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential
314710	318870	candidate Fernando Villavicencio. The extension comes just days
318870	321730	after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were found dead
321730	325630	in prison. A hoard of coins believed to have belonged to a
325630	329070	Highland clan chief, who was murdered more than 300 years ago,
329190	332430	has been found in Scotland. Alexandra McKenzie reports.
333030	336590	The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the
336590	340850	first major excavation in Glencoe. The dig focused on scattered
340850	344130	rocks believed to have been the MacDonald clan chief's
344130	347450	summer house. More than 300 years after he died in the
347450	351330	Glencoe massacre, an archaeology student taking part in her
351330	355310	first ever dig found the hoard. The University of Glasgow said
355310	360030	the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins. A number of
360030	363410	other artifacts were also discovered at the site, including
363410	367890	a musket and fouling shot, pottery from across Europe and a
367890	370750	powder major. BBC News.
374210	377030	Thank you for that bulletin of news. Hello, your Newsday
377030	379750	from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wohonda and Rob
379750	381810	Young. Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue
381810	385290	to focus on the conflict between Israel and Gaza with
385290	389090	voices from both sides and we'll get all your sports and
389090	390230	business headlines too.
394270	398250	We are starting with the latest development in Israel and
398250	401550	Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up
401550	405090	by the hour. The Israeli military says that at least 700
405090	408210	people have died in the attacks overall, with more than
408210	413190	2000 injured. The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies
413190	416410	at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas
416410	419190	militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday
419190	420210	morning. The wake of the attack took place on Saturday
420210	422970	The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group
422970	426310	is being described as the biggest escalation between
426310	429630	the two sides for decades. In retaliation, Israel
429630	432930	launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400
432930	436730	people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2000 wounded,
437070	439690	according to the latest update from the Palestinian
439690	443090	officials. Video images show many buildings being
443090	446210	blown up in large-scale destruction. Shops are
446210	449130	closed. The streets are empty. The city is said to
449130	452670	be like a ghost town. According to the United Nations,
453230	457490	123,000 Palestinians have now been displaced in Gaza
457490	460530	because of the airstrikes. And many Palestinians say
460530	463490	they are now living in fear of their lives. In the
463490	465890	last hour, we got this voice note from a resident
465890	469550	in Gaza. The last couple of days were harrowing
469550	474190	and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge. Gaza
474190	478210	is a very highly dense populated area with very
478210	482990	limited geographical area, like with over 2 million
482990	489090	people living in 360 km2, which make it each
489090	492610	and every missile dropped very impactful and damaging.
493570	496950	The offensive launched from Gaza can only be
496950	500730	understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing
500730	504310	decades-long military occupation and settler
504310	507730	colonization of Palestinian land and the
507730	511590	composition of a system of oppression that meets
511590	515390	the legal definition of apartheid. Meanwhile,
515650	518850	Israeli also has maintained a brutal placate
518850	524370	on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians
527010	531110	refusing its population access to basic supplies
531110	536170	and material needs to survive and trapping them
536170	542030	in amounts to an open air prison with restrictions
542030	544810	on right to movement, right to help and many
544810	549210	other associated basic rights. Yet we were told
549210	552470	as civilians to leave. I mean, leave and go
552470	556730	where? No crossings are open, neither the
556730	559710	sea that is also have restriction to some point.
560410	563390	If you trespass, you can be shot. For the
563390	566610	past few days, hundreds of Palestinians were
566610	569070	killed, including women, children, elderly,
569450	572510	and persons with disabilities. I mean,
572650	575390	thousands of people are internally displaced
575390	579830	to school shelters that not even fully prepared
579830	582570	or equipped to accommodate these numbers and
582570	586750	provide for their needs. I mean, Israel has
586750	588850	to adhere to the international humanitarian
588850	591990	laws in conflict and its principles. These
591990	594710	principles require Israel to respect the
594710	597950	distinction between competence and civilians,
599210	606650	avoid disproportionate use of force, and have
607390	611350	responsibility for the humanitarian supplies
611350	617150	for the population. And now there is limited
619930	624330	electricity and crossings are fully closed to
624330	628650	let in any supplies. But in ground, all that
628650	631730	is happening are against these principles. And
631730	633850	the international community has to play a
633850	636930	role in ending this bloodshed and killing
636930	641150	of civilians. A resident in Gaza there about
641150	643790	what the last couple of days have been like.
643790	645690	And if you want to keep up to date with
645690	648630	the latest, just go to bbc.com forward slash
648630	651330	news. There is a live page of being updated
651330	653450	as we get more news. Well, we're going to
653450	656270	head to Israel and speak to the country's
656270	658790	special envoy for combating anti-Semitism,
659070	661530	a former member of the Knesset, the Israeli
661530	663790	Parliament, Mikhal Kotlov. Thanks so much
663790	668810	for joining us. How are Israelis feeling
668810	673570	today? You know, I think that what you just
673570	676610	actually framed as how Israelis are feeling
677490	680270	is... it actually encourages me to ask you
680270	682950	the question. Because, you know, when I
682950	685470	hear the framing of what is happening in
685470	688850	Israel, where a genocidal terror organization
688850	692050	holding two million civilians in Gaza
692050	695130	alongside all those civilians in Israel
695130	697690	that were targeted on Saturday morning as
697690	700930	we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath
700930	704550	morning and a holiday in Israel, 5,000
704550	706990	rockets launched at Israeli civilians
706990	709670	from densely populated areas in Gaza,
710070	712690	each rocket a double war crime and a
712690	714450	violation of international humanitarian
714450	716670	law. When I think of the massacre
716670	719270	targeting Jews that indiscriminately
719270	724710	shot 260, at least, young party-goers
724710	727170	on that very day of the holiday, when I
727170	730670	think of the anti-Semitic terror
730670	734410	organization, Hamas, actually designated
734410	736950	as a terror organization, funded and
736950	739770	supported by a genocidal regime in Iran,
740290	745210	holding its own civilians in Iran
745210	747530	in the same way that Gaza, in the
747530	748970	same way that ISIS, in the same way
748970	751750	that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the
751750	754750	West, that genocidal terror cannot be
754750	756930	allowed to dictate the way that
756930	759310	sovereign democratic countries conduct
759310	761230	ourselves. So I would turn the question
761230	763370	to you, if this were happening anywhere
763370	765430	else in the world, not only for
765430	767810	Israel's right to defend its
767810	769570	civilians, but Israel's, indeed,
769890	771630	responsibility to defend its
771630	773530	civilians, where the majority of those
773530	778190	targeted over the last 48 hours are,
778190	783090	indeed, civilians and holding
783090	786170	families of Holocaust survivors being
786170	788550	abducted into the Gaza Strip of
788550	790210	Israel, their entire families being
790210	794030	butchered in their homes, and to hear
794030	796790	the way that the framing that BBC
797550	799790	enables this situation is actually
799790	801530	part and parcel of what enables
801530	804430	genocidal terror to control and to
804430	805830	continue to dictate the discourse.
805950	807210	Well, I think you'll find that
807210	810010	we're talking to as many different
810550	813130	people with as many perspectives on
813130	814790	this as we can. I asked you how
814790	816790	Israelis were feeling, and I got a
816790	820210	sense from you of the anger there is
820210	822150	and the sadness, too. No, there is no
822150	823930	anger. We are fighting for our lives.
824070	826290	There is no anger. Let it be clear.
827010	829450	You said that this is like
829450	832630	Israel's 9-11. Is that because of
832630	834350	the shock that this was able to
834350	836650	happen? It's not just because of
836650	838630	this shock. It's because of the same
838630	841730	modus operandi. This is a terror
841730	844510	organization listed as such in most of
844510	846090	the countries that are listening to us
846090	849010	at the moment. Terror is not a moral
849010	850950	equivalency to a sovereign country
850950	853130	that must defend its citizens from
853130	856050	terror. You cannot speak about both
856050	858070	sides if you actually want to
858070	860070	understand what Israelis are feeling.
860310	862350	There is no both sides. When a
862350	865810	terror organization ravages civilian
865810	868990	areas, enters under the guise of
868990	871030	5,000 rockets targeting those
871030	873850	civilians, breaking barriers, that
873850	875690	there is a fence. There has not been
875690	878690	any occupation of Gaza since 2005.
879810	881090	There has been a blockade, though,
881110	882690	hasn't there, of Gaza? No. No, there
882690	884690	is no blockade because there are
884690	886730	thousands, thousands of workers
886730	889290	entering Gaza every day to work in
889290	891530	Israel. There are thousands of
891530	893630	truckloads. There is electricity and
893630	895310	water still being supplied, although
895310	897770	Hamas has responsibility for the
897770	899670	civilians in Gaza, because that's who
899670	903030	was elected to reign over Gaza. And
903030	904470	there is a responsibility of the
904470	906450	international community and of all
906450	907870	those that cherish life and liberty
907870	910010	to hold Hamas to account for holding
910010	913030	those 2 million civilians in Gaza
913030	915490	hostage to their war crimes, not
915490	917170	only on Israel but on Gaza's
917770	918710	civilians. How do you think the
918710	920270	Israeli military should respond then?
920410	924390	We've seen more than 500 airstrikes
924390	925550	over the weekend. How do you think
925550	926950	the Israeli military should respond?
927610	929570	Well, my job is to ask questions, not
929570	931530	answer them. Well, I'm wondering what
931530	933270	you think any country must do in order
933270	934650	to protect its civilians when they're
934650	936710	being attacked, including as we speak
936710	939950	in their homes, including as we speak.
939990	942070	There is an ongoing war here with
942070	944610	genocidal terror. This is not two
944610	946630	countries fighting each other. A
946630	948550	genocidal terror organization, ISIS,
948730	951670	if you will, 9-11, needs moral
951670	953990	clarity. And this is not just about
953990	955910	Jews around the world who are now
955910	957510	under attack. So to my question, how
957510	958550	do you think the military should
958550	959950	respond? There's been speculation
959950	962070	that there might be a ground invasion
962070	964730	of Gaza, although we're told there are
964730	969330	dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza
969330	971210	at the moment. Do you think a
971210	973030	ground invasion is the way for the
973030	974170	Israeli government to go?
974970	976770	There are dozens of Israeli
976770	978950	hostages, and many of them are
978950	981230	civilians that were abducted, many
981230	983770	of them raped, many of them paraded
983770	985710	around the streets of Gaza and
985710	989650	celebrated. And the Israeli IDF will
989650	991690	do everything that it needs to do to
991690	994290	protect as it must the citizens of
994290	996170	the state of Israel under attack as
996170	999830	we speak. And every country that
999830	1002890	cherishes life and liberty must
1002890	1006010	protect its citizens from an ongoing
1007010	1009130	onslaught massacre of its
1009130	1011130	civilians. And those hostages that
1011130	1012950	have been held are being held by a
1012950	1014270	genocidal terror organization. And I
1014270	1016390	want to make it very clear, alongside
1016390	1018690	two Israeli deceased soldiers and
1018690	1020230	two civilians that have been held by
1020230	1022170	the same genocidal terror organization
1022170	1025070	in a nine-year standing violation of
1025070	1026650	international law and human rights.
1027070	1029210	And each one of those civilians and
1029210	1031050	every one of our countries must call
1031050	1032810	for the immediate and unconditional
1032810	1034910	return, because it is countries
1034910	1037870	supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas,
1038430	1040730	a genocidal terror organization, to
1040730	1043330	hold those civilians hostage as we
1043330	1045330	speak. And what the IDF will have
1045330	1046710	to do and the state of Israel will
1046710	1048950	have to do in its existential war is
1048950	1050490	not just about the state of Israel.
1050650	1052030	I want to make it very clear to your
1052030	1052450	listeners.
1053190	1054410	Michal Kotler-Wunsch, we've got to
1054410	1055710	leave it there. Thanks for joining us.
1056750	1058510	Well, same with this story and
1058510	1060150	looking at the business side of
1060150	1061870	things. One industry that's already
1061870	1064390	filling the impact of this conflict
1064390	1066370	is the aviation industry, with
1066370	1068350	dozens of flights already canceled.
1068770	1070270	Let's get the details with our
1070270	1072150	business correspondent in Singapore,
1072510	1074250	Katie Silva. Katie, what are we
1074250	1074570	seeing?
1075670	1077530	Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many
1077530	1079350	airlines canceling flights. The likes,
1079450	1081410	for example, of American Airlines, Air
1081410	1083470	France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryan
1083470	1085590	Air all canceled journeys. British
1085590	1087410	Airways, for its part, told the BBC
1087410	1089230	that it's only canceled one flight
1089230	1091470	on Sunday and that it's going to be
1091470	1093310	adjusting departure times for flights
1093310	1094350	in the coming days. And that's
1094350	1095790	unclear if that's because of
1096210	1097750	disruption at the airport or if
1097750	1099510	perhaps they want to land at
1099510	1100610	different times of the day that may
1100610	1102670	be deemed safer. Many of these
1102670	1103790	airlines are also offering
1104490	1106410	passengers to cancel their flights
1106410	1108630	or to move the dates with no
1108630	1109630	sort of change fees.
1110590	1112310	Flights to Israel's second international
1112310	1114330	airport, Eliat, which is a tourist
1114330	1115350	destination on the Red Sea, they've
1115350	1117090	been unaffected. But we've also heard
1117090	1119410	that Israel's flag carrier, El Al,
1119590	1120570	it's said that it's going to be
1120570	1122130	maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv
1122130	1124590	for now, but again allowing airlines
1124590	1127250	and passengers to change their
1127250	1128850	flights. But Katie, this also
1128850	1130350	comes at the same time as many
1130350	1132550	Israelis are trying or desperately
1132550	1133790	trying to leave.
1135050	1137210	Oh, to leave as well as to get
1137210	1138330	home. So that's one of the major
1138330	1139770	issues is that many have found
1139770	1141690	themselves stranded and with fears
1141690	1144190	about whether or not the
1144190	1145810	airspace will be closed.
1146190	1147530	So one of our reporters, for example,
1147530	1149250	was actually there amongst them
1149250	1150990	stranded in Cyprus, at Lanica
1150990	1153050	International Airport late last night.
1153570	1155230	Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of
1155230	1156730	Israelis hoping to get one of the
1156730	1158710	last flights home. As I say,
1158710	1160270	there are still rumours about whether or not
1160270	1162050	the country may close its airspace.
1162390	1164050	It was hard to get tickets, we understand.
1164210	1166030	Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for
1166030	1167570	example, for no shows on the fully
1167570	1169670	booked flights and getting back into the
1169670	1171230	country certainly hasn't been easy.
1171610	1173610	In terms of leaving the country, we've heard, for example,
1173750	1175750	as well from Athens, the foreign
1175750	1178150	ministry saying that it's working to repatriate
1178150	1180110	about 149 Greek tourists
1180110	1181990	from Israel. Some of them were
1181990	1183930	due to arrive back late last night
1183930	1186710	into Greece. But there is
1186710	1188850	concern about many of the foreign
1188850	1190790	workers in Israel. I know, for example, Thailand
1190790	1192850	has about 30,000 workers
1192850	1194750	in Israel and so governments around
1194750	1196690	the world looking at how they can get their citizens home
1196690	1198290	if indeed they want to leave Israel.
1199290	1200750	Alright, Katie Silva, always a pleasure
1200750	1202670	to have you on the program, our business
1202670	1204450	correspondent there in Singapore.
1204770	1206750	And we are remaining with this
1206750	1208570	story and we are now going to speak to
1208570	1211070	our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
1211130	1212410	Good morning to you, Jeremy.
1212510	1215010	Now, you have called this a major
1215010	1217570	Middle East crisis. Can you elaborate
1217570	1218930	that for us, please, if you may?
1220170	1221150	Well, it's
1221150	1222990	unprecedented that
1222990	1224550	the Palestinian
1224550	1227250	armed group, Hamas, has
1227250	1229390	been able to break out of Gaza,
1229570	1231190	which is surrounded
1231190	1233010	by, if you like, a ring of steel,
1233290	1235200	of fences, wire fences and concrete,
1236090	1236990	break out
1236990	1239230	and kill huge
1239230	1240950	numbers of Israelis,
1241050	1242890	including many, many civilians.
1242890	1244670	That kind of thing
1244670	1247090	is something that Israel hasn't experienced
1247090	1248790	before and
1248790	1250450	it's becoming
1250450	1252690	clear that it's a national
1252690	1255330	trauma and plenty of people here
1255330	1256870	compare it to the 9-11
1256870	1258730	attacks in the United States.
1259150	1261010	There's even one article
1261010	1262630	in one of the newspapers here saying that
1262630	1265010	if you adjust the death toll for population
1265010	1266770	it's the equivalent of the Americans
1266770	1268790	losing more than 20,000
1268790	1271110	on 9-11. So, it's
1271110	1273470	a big, big event
1273470	1275350	and the Israeli response,
1275370	1277430	which is going to be, is already
1277430	1279070	very heavy military action,
1279330	1281270	but they think there will be a
1281270	1282690	land invasion, too, of Gaza.
1283450	1285250	Now, that also is something
1285250	1287350	that could have reverberations right
1287350	1289110	across the region. So,
1289210	1291170	we're into really unexplored
1291170	1292190	territory right now.
1293550	1295190	And, Jeremy, you have been in
1295190	1296790	the region, you have been in the area.
1296910	1299270	Just for our listeners' benefit, can you
1299270	1301410	describe what Gaza Strip looks like
1301410	1303210	and how that area is to
1303210	1303910	Israel?
1306630	1307450	Gaza is
1307450	1309410	a narrow strip of land
1309830	1311430	along the Mediterranean
1311430	1313630	coast, which is surrounded
1313630	1315150	mostly by Israel,
1315630	1317370	but with
1317370	1319230	a narrow border
1319230	1321090	which also goes into
1321090	1321690	Egypt.
1324190	1325210	The Palestinian
1325210	1327610	population of Gaza is around 2.4
1327610	1329190	million people,
1329490	1331610	many of them are descendants of
1332190	1333590	families who lost their
1333590	1335510	homes when Israel was created
1335510	1337130	in 1948,
1337510	1339750	a time that the Palestinians call the Nakba,
1340070	1340990	the catastrophe.
1342070	1343850	And it's an area where people
1343850	1345370	are mostly very poor,
1345490	1347550	they live in very difficult and
1347550	1349630	cramped conditions, they're
1349630	1351830	mostly not allowed to leave the area.
1352330	1353610	There are plenty of
1353610	1355850	adults there who've never left.
1355850	1357350	And so
1357350	1359770	it is a situation
1360490	1361910	which is... life
1361910	1364230	there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic
1364230	1365890	and since 2007
1365890	1368050	it's been controlled by the Palestinian
1368470	1369970	militant group, Hamas,
1370070	1372010	which is an Arabic acronym
1372010	1373730	for the Islamic resistance movement.
1374450	1375850	And you wrote a
1376510	1377930	nice read on our website
1377930	1379550	where you said that, you know, Hamas
1379550	1381890	blindsided Israel with what you
1381890	1383850	call the most serious attack in a
1383850	1386170	generation. And we're hearing stories
1386170	1387870	of hostages that have been taken
1387870	1390130	including civilians as well as soldiers.
1390590	1392110	What sort of challenge does
1392110	1393930	this pose for the government of Mr.
1394030	1395970	Netanyahu and the army going forward?
1397110	1398230	It's the most profound
1398230	1399990	challenge that any Israel government
1399990	1401810	has, I think, faced probably
1401810	1403910	for 50 years since
1403910	1406050	the 1973 Middle East War.
1407850	1410070	He is... his political enemies
1410070	1411910	are already blaming him, saying
1411910	1414390	that he took his arm off the ball
1414390	1416110	for a variety of reasons.
1416850	1417910	It's clear that there's
1417910	1420010	been, from the Israeli perspective, a huge
1420010	1421150	intelligence failure.
1421730	1424010	And they're struggling militarily to assert
1424010	1425990	themselves. They will succeed in
1425990	1427770	doing that, I'm pretty certain,
1427790	1429730	because Israel has got very powerful
1429730	1432030	armed forces. I think the big
1432030	1434130	question, which was
1434130	1435610	and this is
1436390	1438090	probably an equal challenge
1438090	1439470	for the Israelis,
1439470	1442250	is what happens after that?
1442430	1443470	How do they...
1444450	1445590	what happens in Gaza
1445590	1447490	on the day that they leave?
1447570	1449690	Because the Israelis, who used to
1449690	1451490	occupy Gaza, and
1451490	1453470	finally pulled out in 2005,
1455450	1457690	do not want to get back into a full scale
1457690	1459790	occupation. But if they send in their troops,
1460530	1461650	there's going to have to be
1461650	1462930	some kind of governance
1463430	1465670	of a territory, which is maybe
1465670	1467010	small, but as I said,
1468310	1469290	contains getting on
1469290	1470830	for two and a half million people.
1472070	1473110	Jeremy Bowen there,
1473150	1475150	thank you for coming on the programme. He is our
1475150	1476370	international editor.
1483410	1484570	We're going to move away from our top
1484570	1486510	story. We will return to it later on in the programme
1486510	1488430	though. Isaac Fanon is here. He's going to give us
1488430	1490450	some sports headlines. Yeah, took Arsenal 12
1490450	1492590	goals, but they finally beat Manchester
1492590	1494250	City in the Premier League. Gabriel
1494250	1496330	Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th
1496330	1498430	minute as City lost their second game
1498430	1500850	in the Premier League in a row for the first
1500850	1502830	time. That's happened in five years.
1503390	1504590	European football's governing body
1504590	1506750	UEFA has postponed all matches scheduled
1506750	1508530	in Israel during the next fortnight
1508990	1510710	amid increased tensions in the
1510710	1512490	region. Israel were due to play
1512490	1514510	Switzerland in a Euro 2024
1514510	1516630	qualifier in Tel Aviv, but that
1516630	1518510	game has been rescheduled and UEFA said
1518510	1520510	it will assess the situation over
1520510	1522750	the coming days to see whether Israel's
1522750	1524890	away qualifier in Kosovo
1524890	1526670	will still take place on the 15th
1526670	1528770	of October. To athletics news
1528770	1530650	next, Kenyan Kelvin Kipton
1530650	1532730	shattered the men's marathon world
1532730	1534390	record in Chicago. He beat
1534390	1536970	his compatriot Eli Kipchoge's previous
1536970	1538870	match by more than 30 seconds.
1539350	1540770	The 23-year-old finished in a
1540770	1542650	time of two hours, 35
1542650	1544690	seconds. And Australia are out
1544690	1546490	of the Rugby World Cup despite
1546490	1548730	Fiji losing 24-23 to
1548730	1550810	Portugal in the final pool stage
1550810	1552630	match. Fiji got a losing bonus
1552630	1554910	point and they qualify at Australia's
1554910	1557150	expense due to their 22-15
1557150	1558830	victory way back in
1558830	1560850	September. Isaac, thank you very much
1560850	1562890	indeed. Now we are
1562890	1564930	going to turn to
1564930	1566930	Afghanistan because thousands of people
1566930	1568550	in the west of the country
1568550	1570790	are spending a second night in the
1570790	1572810	open after a strong earthquake on
1572810	1574710	Saturday reduced entire villages
1574710	1576810	to rubble. There's been confusion about
1576810	1578430	the number of dead with Taliban
1578430	1580590	officials apologising for an early
1580590	1582930	assessment that more than 2,000
1582930	1585070	people had died. The United Nations
1585070	1587050	humanitarian agency says that
1587050	1588950	more than 1,000 have been
1588950	1590850	killed and more than 500 are
1590850	1592790	still missing. I'm now joined
1592790	1594950	by my colleague from the Afghan
1594950	1597050	service, Angela Gehr. Good morning
1597050	1599070	to you, Angela. What is the latest
1599070	1600610	that you can tell us about this
1600610	1601810	devastating event?
1602930	1604370	Good morning.
1605810	1606950	The news I'm
1607530	1608950	receiving from Afghanistan
1608950	1611230	is actually
1611230	1613410	I can say that is a very,
1613410	1615230	very, very big...
1619810	1620970	the darkest
1620970	1623710	time that we are experiencing
1623710	1625710	in Afghanistan. The number
1625710	1627590	that the Taliban
1627590	1629230	are trying to
1629930	1631230	share with the media
1631230	1633230	is very different what we
1634190	1635190	have receiving
1635190	1637630	from the people. I think
1637630	1639150	in that area
1639150	1641310	we have, we had
1641310	1643270	more than 20
1643270	1645250	violets which are
1645250	1646730	completely destroyed
1648170	1649610	in the
1650090	1650990	earthquake.
1651710	1653330	And also there
1653330	1655330	is no way for the
1655330	1656910	actually in the first hour
1656910	1659270	the Taliban tried to control the medias.
1659830	1661370	We didn't receive the
1661370	1663230	actually we thought that everything
1663230	1665010	is not that
1665010	1667190	bad what
1668210	1668810	we
1668810	1671370	when we
1671370	1673630	sent the volunteers
1673630	1675070	group to the area.
1676710	1677310	Actually
1677310	1678310	I'm so sorry.
1679190	1681490	No, don't worry. And so Angela, basically
1681490	1683430	the Taliban have gone
1683430	1685410	back to what they said. The numbers have changed.
1685590	1687170	But what are people saying
1687170	1689390	on the ground, those who have been affected?
1691590	1692790	They don't
1692790	1695030	accept the numbers which
1695030	1696530	the Taliban is shedding.
1697370	1699270	Actually, and also
1699830	1701130	I think more
1701130	1703510	than 2,000 people are killed.
1704210	1705350	A thousand people
1705350	1706250	displaced.
1707430	1708930	A thousand people are
1708930	1711010	missing in this
1711010	1712410	crisis.
1713330	1715270	And we have
1715270	1716930	nothing at that moment.
1717370	1719270	At this moment there are
1719270	1720990	no big
1720990	1723210	offer or support from
1723210	1725890	the Taliban for the people.
1727050	1728170	Just the
1728170	1729210	Red Cross and
1730930	1732050	MSF provided
1732050	1734070	some help for the people
1734070	1735890	and the volunteers
1735890	1736990	group from
1736990	1738470	other cities.
