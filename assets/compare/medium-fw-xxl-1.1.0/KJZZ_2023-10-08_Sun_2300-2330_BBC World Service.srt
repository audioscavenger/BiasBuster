00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,500
This morning we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,560
more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza. We hear from a woman in Gaza.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,680
The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,940
Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with each and every missile very impactful

8
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,120
and damaging.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,240
In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival,

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,460
the first site attacked by Hamas.

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,680
We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,440
has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,580
And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than

14
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,520
2,000 people. Rescue efforts are continuing. But first, we're getting a bulletin of

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,060
World News.

16
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,190
This is Danielle Yavavetska with the BBC News. Hello.

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,130
The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,950
500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip. Operations are continuing against Palestinian

19
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,250
Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel, two days after they carried out

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,530
their devastating mass assault. More than 700 Israelis have been killed.

21
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,390
John Donison is in Jerusalem.

22
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,090
The Israeli military says it has continued to target Hamas infrastructure with airstrikes

23
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,950
overnight. The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced,

24
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,410
with many seeking shelter in UN schools. But most believe this is just the beginning.

25
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,170
Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000

26
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,890
army reservists. Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion,

27
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,050
with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in

28
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,370
Gaza.

29
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,390
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far

30
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,670
by Israeli airstrikes. Over 2,000 people have been injured. They said power cuts were

31
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,230
widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical workers. Hamas said it had fired

32
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,090
a new barrage of missiles into Israel. Three US air carriers, as well as Air

33
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,970
France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended flights to Tel Aviv.

34
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,230
The United States says it is sending immediate extra munitions to Israel. The

35
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,410
Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier,

36
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,690
to the eastern Mediterranean. More from Barbara Platasha in Washington.

37
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,450
The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel

38
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,310
and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region. They are sending an aircraft

39
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,250
carrier with a deck of warplanes, accompanied by cruisers and destroyers. Also extra

40
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,310
military assistance, such as munitions.

41
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,870
In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining

42
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,310
the fight. It is backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas. There are reports

43
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,870
that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack, although the Secretary of State

44
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,210
Antony Blinken said the US hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.

45
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,310
The UN Security Council has held an emergency closed-door session to

46
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,950
discuss the crisis. The UN Middle East envoy called on countries to exert

47
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,410
diplomatic efforts to restore calm. More from Nedda Taufik in New York.

48
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,750
Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement. Not all,

49
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,830
but many condemned Hamas. The UAE's ambassador to the UN, Lanin Acebe, told

50
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,890
reporters there was real concern that tensions in the region could become

51
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,170
inflamed. Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan,

52
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,910
showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.

53
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,370
The Palestinian UN ambassador, Riyad Mansour, told reporters he'd

54
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,390
requested an emergency meeting of Arab League states in Cairo.

55

BBC World News.

56
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,610
An independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into

57
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,570
allegations that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed

58
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,130
civilians, including children in Afghanistan. The inquiry was set up by

59
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,230
the British government after legal action was brought by two Afghan

60
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:34,270
families. The US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a

61
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,150
bipartisan delegation to China, has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

62
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,070
Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit as

63
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,170
Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing. Regional elections in two

64
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,590
of Germany's largest and wealthiest states, Bavaria and Hesse, have

65
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,750
dealt a blow to the parties that form the centre-left federal

66
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,530
government. Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats,

67
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,470
the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats. The Christian Democrats

68
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,310
again emerge as the largest party. The president of Ecuador has

69
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,310
extended the state of emergency by 30 days. It's been in place since

70
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,710
the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential

71
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,870
candidate Fernando Villavicencio. The extension comes just days

72
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,730
after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were found dead

73
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,630
in prison. A hoard of coins believed to have belonged to a

74
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,070
Highland clan chief, who was murdered more than 300 years ago,

75
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,430
has been found in Scotland. Alexandra McKenzie reports.

76
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,590
The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the

77
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,850
first major excavation in Glencoe. The dig focused on scattered

78
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,130
rocks believed to have been the MacDonald clan chief's

79
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,450
summer house. More than 300 years after he died in the

80
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,330
Glencoe massacre, an archaeology student taking part in her

81
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,310
first ever dig found the hoard. The University of Glasgow said

82
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,030
the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins. A number of

83
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,410
other artifacts were also discovered at the site, including

84
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,890
a musket and fouling shot, pottery from across Europe and a

85
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,750
powder major. BBC News.

86
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,030
Thank you for that bulletin of news. Hello, your Newsday

87
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,750
from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wohonda and Rob

88
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,810
Young. Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue

89
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,290
to focus on the conflict between Israel and Gaza with

90
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,090
voices from both sides and we'll get all your sports and

91
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,230
business headlines too.

92
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,250
We are starting with the latest development in Israel and

93
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,550
Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up

94
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,090
by the hour. The Israeli military says that at least 700

95
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,210
people have died in the attacks overall, with more than

96
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,190
2000 injured. The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies

97
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,410
at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas

98
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,190
militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday

99
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,210
morning. The wake of the attack took place on Saturday

100
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,970
The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group

101
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,310
is being described as the biggest escalation between

102
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,630
the two sides for decades. In retaliation, Israel

103
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,930
launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400

104
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,730
people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2000 wounded,

105
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,690
according to the latest update from the Palestinian

106
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,090
officials. Video images show many buildings being

107
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,210
blown up in large-scale destruction. Shops are

108
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,130
closed. The streets are empty. The city is said to

109
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,670
be like a ghost town. According to the United Nations,

110
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,490
123,000 Palestinians have now been displaced in Gaza

111
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,530
because of the airstrikes. And many Palestinians say

112
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,490
they are now living in fear of their lives. In the

113
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,890
last hour, we got this voice note from a resident

114
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,550
in Gaza. The last couple of days were harrowing

115
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,190
and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge. Gaza

116
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,210
is a very highly dense populated area with very

117
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,990
limited geographical area, like with over 2 million

118
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:09,090
people living in 360 km2, which make it each

119
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,610
and every missile dropped very impactful and damaging.

120
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,950
The offensive launched from Gaza can only be

121
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,730
understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing

122
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,310
decades-long military occupation and settler

123
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,730
colonization of Palestinian land and the

124
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,590
composition of a system of oppression that meets

125
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,390
the legal definition of apartheid. Meanwhile,

126
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,850
Israeli also has maintained a brutal placate

127
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:44,370
on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians

128
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,110
refusing its population access to basic supplies

129
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,170
and material needs to survive and trapping them

130
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,030
in amounts to an open air prison with restrictions

131
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,810
on right to movement, right to help and many

132
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,210
other associated basic rights. Yet we were told

133
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,470
as civilians to leave. I mean, leave and go

134
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,730
where? No crossings are open, neither the

135
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,710
sea that is also have restriction to some point.

136
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,390
If you trespass, you can be shot. For the

137
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,610
past few days, hundreds of Palestinians were

138
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,070
killed, including women, children, elderly,

139
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,510
and persons with disabilities. I mean,

140
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,390
thousands of people are internally displaced

141
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,830
to school shelters that not even fully prepared

142
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,570
or equipped to accommodate these numbers and

143
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,750
provide for their needs. I mean, Israel has

144
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,850
to adhere to the international humanitarian

145
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,990
laws in conflict and its principles. These

146
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,710
principles require Israel to respect the

147
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,950
distinction between competence and civilians,

148
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:06,650
avoid disproportionate use of force, and have

149
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,350
responsibility for the humanitarian supplies

150
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,150
for the population. And now there is limited

151
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,330
electricity and crossings are fully closed to

152
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,650
let in any supplies. But in ground, all that

153
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,730
is happening are against these principles. And

154
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,850
the international community has to play a

155
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,930
role in ending this bloodshed and killing

156
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,150
of civilians. A resident in Gaza there about

157
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,790
what the last couple of days have been like.

158
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,690

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,450
as we get more news. Well, we're going to

162
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,270
head to Israel and speak to the country's

163
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,790
special envoy for combating anti-Semitism,

164
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,530
a former member of the Knesset, the Israeli

165
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,790
Parliament, Mikhal Kotlov. Thanks so much

166
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,810
for joining us. How are Israelis feeling

167
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,570
today? You know, I think that what you just

168
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,610
actually framed as how Israelis are feeling

169
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,270
is... it actually encourages me to ask you

170
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,950
the question. Because, you know, when I

171
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,470
hear the framing of what is happening in

172
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,850
Israel, where a genocidal terror organization

173
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,050
holding two million civilians in Gaza

174
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,130
alongside all those civilians in Israel

175
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,690
that were targeted on Saturday morning as

176
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,930
we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath

177
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,550
morning and a holiday in Israel, 5,000

178
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,990
rockets launched at Israeli civilians

179
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,670
from densely populated areas in Gaza,

180
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,690
each rocket a double war crime and a

181
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,450
violation of international humanitarian

182
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,670
law. When I think of the massacre

183
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,270
targeting Jews that indiscriminately

184
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:04,710
shot 260, at least, young party-goers

185
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,170
on that very day of the holiday, when I

186
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,670
think of the anti-Semitic terror

187
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,410
organization, Hamas, actually designated

188
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,950
as a terror organization, funded and

189
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,770
supported by a genocidal regime in Iran,

190
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,210
holding its own civilians in Iran

191
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,530
in the same way that Gaza, in the

192
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,970
same way that ISIS, in the same way

193
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,750
that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the

194
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,750
West, that genocidal terror cannot be

195
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,930
allowed to dictate the way that

196
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,310
sovereign democratic countries conduct

197
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,230
ourselves. So I would turn the question

198
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,370
to you, if this were happening anywhere

199
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,430
else in the world, not only for

200
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,810
Israel's right to defend its

201
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,570
civilians, but Israel's, indeed,

202
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,630
responsibility to defend its

203
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,530
civilians, where the majority of those

204
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,190
targeted over the last 48 hours are,

205
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:03,090
indeed, civilians and holding

206
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,170
families of Holocaust survivors being

207
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,550
abducted into the Gaza Strip of

208
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,210
Israel, their entire families being

209
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,030
butchered in their homes, and to hear

210
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,790
the way that the framing that BBC

211
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,790
enables this situation is actually

212
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,530
part and parcel of what enables

213
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,430
genocidal terror to control and to

214
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,830
continue to dictate the discourse.

215
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,210
Well, I think you'll find that

216
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,010
we're talking to as many different

217
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,130
people with as many perspectives on

218
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,790
this as we can. I asked you how

219
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,790
Israelis were feeling, and I got a

220
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,210
sense from you of the anger there is

221
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,150
and the sadness, too. No, there is no

222
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,930
anger. We are fighting for our lives.

223
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,290
There is no anger. Let it be clear.

224
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,450
You said that this is like

225
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,630
Israel's 9-11. Is that because of

226
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,350
the shock that this was able to

227
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,650
happen? It's not just because of

228
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,630
this shock. It's because of the same

229
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,730
modus operandi. This is a terror

230
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,510
organization listed as such in most of

231
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,090
the countries that are listening to us

232
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,010
at the moment. Terror is not a moral

233
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,950
equivalency to a sovereign country

234
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,130
that must defend its citizens from

235
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,050
terror. You cannot speak about both

236
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,070
sides if you actually want to

237
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,070
understand what Israelis are feeling.

238
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,350
There is no both sides. When a

239
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,810
terror organization ravages civilian

240
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,990
areas, enters under the guise of

241
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,030
5,000 rockets targeting those

242
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,850
civilians, breaking barriers, that

243
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,690
there is a fence. There has not been

244
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,690
any occupation of Gaza since 2005.

245
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,090
There has been a blockade, though,

246
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,690
hasn't there, of Gaza? No. No, there

247
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,690
is no blockade because there are

248
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,730
thousands, thousands of workers

249
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,290
entering Gaza every day to work in

250
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,530
Israel. There are thousands of

251
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,630
truckloads. There is electricity and

252
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,310
water still being supplied, although

253
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,770
Hamas has responsibility for the

254
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,670
civilians in Gaza, because that's who

255
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,030
was elected to reign over Gaza. And

256
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,470
there is a responsibility of the

257
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,450
international community and of all

258
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,870
those that cherish life and liberty

259
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,010
to hold Hamas to account for holding

260
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,030
those 2 million civilians in Gaza

261
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,490
hostage to their war crimes, not

262
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,170
only on Israel but on Gaza's

263
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,710
civilians. How do you think the

264
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,270
Israeli military should respond then?

265
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,390
We've seen more than 500 airstrikes

266
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,550
over the weekend. How do you think

267
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,950
the Israeli military should respond?

268
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,570
Well, my job is to ask questions, not

269
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,530
answer them. Well, I'm wondering what

270
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,270
you think any country must do in order

271
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,650
to protect its civilians when they're

272
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,710
being attacked, including as we speak

273
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,950
in their homes, including as we speak.

274
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,070
There is an ongoing war here with

275
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,610
genocidal terror. This is not two

276
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,630
countries fighting each other. A

277
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,550
genocidal terror organization, ISIS,

278
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,670
if you will, 9-11, needs moral

279
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,990
clarity. And this is not just about

280
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,910
Jews around the world who are now

281
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,510
under attack. So to my question, how

282
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,550
do you think the military should

283
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,950
respond? There's been speculation

284
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,070
that there might be a ground invasion

285
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,730
of Gaza, although we're told there are

286
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,330
dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza

287
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,210
at the moment. Do you think a

288
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,030
ground invasion is the way for the

289
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,170
Israeli government to go?

290
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,770
There are dozens of Israeli

291
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,950
hostages, and many of them are

292
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,230
civilians that were abducted, many

293
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,770
of them raped, many of them paraded

294
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,710
around the streets of Gaza and

295
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,650
celebrated. And the Israeli IDF will

296
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,690
do everything that it needs to do to

297
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,290
protect as it must the citizens of

298
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,170
the state of Israel under attack as

299
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,830
we speak. And every country that

300
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,890
cherishes life and liberty must

301
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,010
protect its citizens from an ongoing

302
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,130
onslaught massacre of its

303
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,130
civilians. And those hostages that

304
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,950
have been held are being held by a

305
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,270
genocidal terror organization. And I

306
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,390
want to make it very clear, alongside

307
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,690
two Israeli deceased soldiers and

308
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,230
two civilians that have been held by

309
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,170
the same genocidal terror organization

310
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,070
in a nine-year standing violation of

311
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,650
international law and human rights.

312
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,210
And each one of those civilians and

313
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,050
every one of our countries must call

314
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,810
for the immediate and unconditional

315
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,910
return, because it is countries

316
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,870
supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas,

317
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,730
a genocidal terror organization, to

318
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,330
hold those civilians hostage as we

319
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,330
speak. And what the IDF will have

320
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,710
to do and the state of Israel will

321
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,950
have to do in its existential war is

322
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,490
not just about the state of Israel.

323
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,030
I want to make it very clear to your

324
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,450
listeners.

325
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,410
Michal Kotler-Wunsch, we've got to

326
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,710
leave it there. Thanks for joining us.

327
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,510
Well, same with this story and

328
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,150
looking at the business side of

329
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,870
things. One industry that's already

330
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,390
filling the impact of this conflict

331
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,370
is the aviation industry, with

332
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,350
dozens of flights already canceled.

333
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,270
Let's get the details with our

334
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,150
business correspondent in Singapore,

335
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,250
Katie Silva. Katie, what are we

336
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,570
seeing?

337
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,530
Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many

338
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,350
airlines canceling flights. The likes,

339
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,410
for example, of American Airlines, Air

340
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,470
France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryan

341
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,590
Air all canceled journeys. British

342
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,410
Airways, for its part, told the BBC

343
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,230
that it's only canceled one flight

344
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,470
on Sunday and that it's going to be

345
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,310
adjusting departure times for flights

346
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,350
in the coming days. And that's

347
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,790
unclear if that's because of

348
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,750
disruption at the airport or if

349
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,510
perhaps they want to land at

350
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,610
different times of the day that may

351
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,670
be deemed safer. Many of these

352
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,790
airlines are also offering

353
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,410
passengers to cancel their flights

354
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,630
or to move the dates with no

355
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,630
sort of change fees.

356
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,310
Flights to Israel's second international

357
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,330
airport, Eliat, which is a tourist

358
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,350
destination on the Red Sea, they've

359
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,090
been unaffected. But we've also heard

360
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,410
that Israel's flag carrier, El Al,

361
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,570
it's said that it's going to be

362
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,130
maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv

363
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,590
for now, but again allowing airlines

364
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,250
and passengers to change their

365
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,850
flights. But Katie, this also

366
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,350
comes at the same time as many

367
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,550
Israelis are trying or desperately

368
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,790
trying to leave.

369
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,210
Oh, to leave as well as to get

370
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,330
home. So that's one of the major

371
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,770
issues is that many have found

372
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,690
themselves stranded and with fears

373
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,190
about whether or not the

374
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,810
airspace will be closed.

375
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,530
So one of our reporters, for example,

376
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,250
was actually there amongst them

377
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,990
stranded in Cyprus, at Lanica

378
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,050
International Airport late last night.

379
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,230
Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of

380
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,730
Israelis hoping to get one of the

381
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,710
last flights home. As I say,

382
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,270
there are still rumours about whether or not

383
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,050
the country may close its airspace.

384
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,050
It was hard to get tickets, we understand.

385
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,030
Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for

386
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,570
example, for no shows on the fully

387
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,670
booked flights and getting back into the

388
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,230
country certainly hasn't been easy.

389
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,610
In terms of leaving the country, we've heard, for example,

390
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,750
as well from Athens, the foreign

391
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,150
ministry saying that it's working to repatriate

392
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,110
about 149 Greek tourists

393
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,990
from Israel. Some of them were

394
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,930
due to arrive back late last night

395
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,710
into Greece. But there is

396
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,850
concern about many of the foreign

397
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,790
workers in Israel. I know, for example, Thailand

398
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,850
has about 30,000 workers

399
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,750
in Israel and so governments around

400
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,690
the world looking at how they can get their citizens home

401
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,290
if indeed they want to leave Israel.

402
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,750
Alright, Katie Silva, always a pleasure

403
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,670
to have you on the program, our business

404
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,450
correspondent there in Singapore.

405
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,750
And we are remaining with this

406
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,570
story and we are now going to speak to

407
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,070
our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.

408
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,410
Good morning to you, Jeremy.

409
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,010
Now, you have called this a major

410
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,570
Middle East crisis. Can you elaborate

411
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,930
that for us, please, if you may?

412
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,150
Well, it's

413
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,990
unprecedented that

414
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,550
the Palestinian

415
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,250
armed group, Hamas, has

416
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,390
been able to break out of Gaza,

417
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,190
which is surrounded

418
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,010
by, if you like, a ring of steel,

419
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,200
of fences, wire fences and concrete,

420
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,990
break out

421
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,230
and kill huge

422
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,950
numbers of Israelis,

423
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,890
including many, many civilians.

424
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,670
That kind of thing

425
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,090
is something that Israel hasn't experienced

426
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,790
before and

427
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,450
it's becoming

428
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,690
clear that it's a national

429
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,330
trauma and plenty of people here

430
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,870
compare it to the 9-11

431
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,730
attacks in the United States.

432
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,010
There's even one article

433
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,630
in one of the newspapers here saying that

434
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,010
if you adjust the death toll for population

435
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,770
it's the equivalent of the Americans

436
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,790
losing more than 20,000

437
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,110
on 9-11. So, it's

438
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,470
a big, big event

439
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,350
and the Israeli response,

440
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,430
which is going to be, is already

441
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,070
very heavy military action,

442
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,270
but they think there will be a

443
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,690
land invasion, too, of Gaza.

444
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,250
Now, that also is something

445
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,350
that could have reverberations right

446
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,110
across the region. So,

447
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,170
we're into really unexplored

448
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,190
territory right now.

449
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,190
And, Jeremy, you have been in

450
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,790
the region, you have been in the area.

451
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,270
Just for our listeners' benefit, can you

452
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,410
describe what Gaza Strip looks like

453
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,210
and how that area is to

454
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:43,910
Israel?

455
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,450
Gaza is

456
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,410
a narrow strip of land

457
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,430
along the Mediterranean

458
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,630
coast, which is surrounded

459
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,150
mostly by Israel,

460
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,370
but with

461
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,230
a narrow border

462
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,090
which also goes into

463
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,690
Egypt.

464
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,210
The Palestinian

465
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,610
population of Gaza is around 2.4

466
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,190
million people,

467
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,610
many of them are descendants of

468
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,590
families who lost their

469
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,510
homes when Israel was created

470
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,130
in 1948,

471
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,750
a time that the Palestinians call the Nakba,

472
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,990
the catastrophe.

473
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,850
And it's an area where people

474
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,370
are mostly very poor,

475
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,550
they live in very difficult and

476
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,630
cramped conditions, they're

477
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,830
mostly not allowed to leave the area.

478
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,610
There are plenty of

479
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,850
adults there who've never left.

480
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,350
And so

481
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,770
it is a situation

482
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,910
which is... life

483
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,230
there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic

484
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,890
and since 2007

485
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,050
it's been controlled by the Palestinian

486
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,970
militant group, Hamas,

487
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,010
which is an Arabic acronym

488
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,730
for the Islamic resistance movement.

489
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,850
And you wrote a

490
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,930
nice read on our website

491
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,550
where you said that, you know, Hamas

492
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,890
blindsided Israel with what you

493
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,850
call the most serious attack in a

494
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,170
generation. And we're hearing stories

495
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,870
of hostages that have been taken

496
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,130
including civilians as well as soldiers.

497
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,110
What sort of challenge does

498
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,930
this pose for the government of Mr.

499
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,970
Netanyahu and the army going forward?

500
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,230
It's the most profound

501
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,990
challenge that any Israel government

502
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,810
has, I think, faced probably

503
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,910
for 50 years since

504
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,050
the 1973 Middle East War.

505
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,070
He is... his political enemies

506
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,910
are already blaming him, saying

507
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,390
that he took his arm off the ball

508
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,110
for a variety of reasons.

509
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,910
It's clear that there's

510
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,010
been, from the Israeli perspective, a huge

511
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,150
intelligence failure.

512
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,010
And they're struggling militarily to assert

513
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,990
themselves. They will succeed in

514
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,770
doing that, I'm pretty certain,

515
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,730
because Israel has got very powerful

516
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,030
armed forces. I think the big

517
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,130
question, which was

518
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,610
and this is

519
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,090
probably an equal challenge

520
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,470
for the Israelis,

521
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,250
is what happens after that?

522
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,470
How do they...

523
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,590
what happens in Gaza

524
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,490
on the day that they leave?

525
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,690
Because the Israelis, who used to

526
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,490
occupy Gaza, and

527
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,470
finally pulled out in 2005,

528
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,690
do not want to get back into a full scale

529
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,790
occupation. But if they send in their troops,

530
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,650
there's going to have to be

531
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,930
some kind of governance

532
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,670
of a territory, which is maybe

533
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,010
small, but as I said,

534
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,290
contains getting on

535
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,830
for two and a half million people.

536
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,110
Jeremy Bowen there,

537
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,150
thank you for coming on the programme. He is our

538
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,370
international editor.

539
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,570
We're going to move away from our top

540
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,510
story. We will return to it later on in the programme

541
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,430
though. Isaac Fanon is here. He's going to give us

542
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,450
some sports headlines. Yeah, took Arsenal 12

543
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,590
goals, but they finally beat Manchester

544
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,250
City in the Premier League. Gabriel

545
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,330
Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th

546
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,430
minute as City lost their second game

547
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,850
in the Premier League in a row for the first

548
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,830
time. That's happened in five years.

549
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,590
European football's governing body

550
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,750
UEFA has postponed all matches scheduled

551
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,530
in Israel during the next fortnight

552
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,710
amid increased tensions in the

553
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,490
region. Israel were due to play

554
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,510
Switzerland in a Euro 2024

555
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,630
qualifier in Tel Aviv, but that

556
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,510
game has been rescheduled and UEFA said

557
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,510
it will assess the situation over

558
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,750
the coming days to see whether Israel's

559
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,890
away qualifier in Kosovo

560
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,670
will still take place on the 15th

561
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,770
of October. To athletics news

562
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,650
next, Kenyan Kelvin Kipton

563
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,730
shattered the men's marathon world

564
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,390
record in Chicago. He beat

565
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,970
his compatriot Eli Kipchoge's previous

566
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,870
match by more than 30 seconds.

567
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,770
The 23-year-old finished in a

568
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,650
time of two hours, 35

569
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,690
seconds. And Australia are out

570
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,490
of the Rugby World Cup despite

571
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,730
Fiji losing 24-23 to

572
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,810
Portugal in the final pool stage

573
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,630
match. Fiji got a losing bonus

574
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,910
point and they qualify at Australia's

575
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,150
expense due to their 22-15

576
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,830
victory way back in

577
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,850
September. Isaac, thank you very much

578
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,890
indeed. Now we are

579
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,930
going to turn to

580
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,930
Afghanistan because thousands of people

581
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,550
in the west of the country

582
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,790
are spending a second night in the

583
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,810
open after a strong earthquake on

584
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,710
Saturday reduced entire villages

585
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,810
to rubble. There's been confusion about

586
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,430
the number of dead with Taliban

587
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,590
officials apologising for an early

588
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,930
assessment that more than 2,000

589
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,070
people had died. The United Nations

590
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,050
humanitarian agency says that

591
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,950
more than 1,000 have been

592
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,850
killed and more than 500 are

593
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,790
still missing. I'm now joined

594
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,950
by my colleague from the Afghan

595
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,050
service, Angela Gehr. Good morning

596
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,070
to you, Angela. What is the latest

597
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,610
that you can tell us about this

598
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,810
devastating event?

599
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,370
Good morning.

600
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,950
The news I'm

601
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,950
receiving from Afghanistan

602
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,230
is actually

603
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,410
I can say that is a very,

604
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,230
very, very big...

605
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,970
the darkest

606
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,710
time that we are experiencing

607
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,710
in Afghanistan. The number

608
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,590
that the Taliban

609
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,230
are trying to

610
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,230
share with the media

611
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,230
is very different what we

612
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,190
have receiving

613
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,630
from the people. I think

614
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,150
in that area

615
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,310
we have, we had

616
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,270
more than 20

617
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,250
violets which are

618
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,730
completely destroyed

619
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,610
in the

620
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,990
earthquake.

621
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,330
And also there

622
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,330
is no way for the

623
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,910
actually in the first hour

624
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,270
the Taliban tried to control the medias.

625
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,370
We didn't receive the

626
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,230
actually we thought that everything

627
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,010
is not that

628
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,190
bad what

629
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:48,810
we

630
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,370
when we

631
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,630
sent the volunteers

632
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,070
group to the area.

633
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,310
Actually

634
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,310
I'm so sorry.

635
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,490
No, don't worry. And so Angela, basically

636
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,430
the Taliban have gone

637
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,410
back to what they said. The numbers have changed.

638
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,170
But what are people saying

639
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,390
on the ground, those who have been affected?

640
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,790
They don't

641
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,030
accept the numbers which

642
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,530
the Taliban is shedding.

643
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,270
Actually, and also

644
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,130
I think more

645
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,510
than 2,000 people are killed.

646
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,350
A thousand people

647
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,250
displaced.

648
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,930
A thousand people are

649
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,010
missing in this

650
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,410
crisis.

651
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,270
And we have

652
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,930
nothing at that moment.

653
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,270
At this moment there are

654
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,990
no big

655
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,210
offer or support from

656
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,890
the Taliban for the people.

657
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,170
Just the

658
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,210
Red Cross and

659
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,050
MSF provided

660
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,070
some help for the people

661
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,890
and the volunteers

662
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,990
group from

663
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,470
other cities.

664
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,070
Thank you so much for coming on to the program, telling us about the

665
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,050
devastating earthquake that has shaken

666
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,890
Afghanistan in the west of the country.

667
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,030
