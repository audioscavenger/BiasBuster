00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:29,560
This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza.

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,420
We hear from a woman in Gaza.

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,440
The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,020
Gaza's very highly-dense populated area with each and every missile very impactful and damaging.

8
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:53,140
In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival, the first site attacked by Hamas.

9
00:00:53,140 --> 00:01:00,120
We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.

10
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,520
And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000 people. Rescue efforts are continuing.

11
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,900
But first, we're getting a bulletin of World News.

12
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,010
This is Danielle Yawovieczka with the BBC News. Hello.

13
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:25,570
The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over 500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

14
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:35,610
Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel two days after they carried out their devastating mass assault.

15
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,170
More than 700 Israelis have been killed. John Donison is in Jerusalem.

16
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,450
The Israeli military says it has continued to target Hamas infrastructure with airstrikes overnight.

17
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,470
The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced, with many seeking shelter in UN schools.

18
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:04,070
But most believe this is just the beginning. Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000 army reservists.

19
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:13,170
Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion, with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

20
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:21,950
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far by Israeli airstrikes. Over 2,000 people have been injured.

21
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:30,090
They said power cuts were widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical workers. Hamas said it had fired a new barrage of missiles into Israel.

22
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,590
Three U.S. air carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended flights to Tel Aviv.

23
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:47,570
The United States says it's sending immediate extra munitions to Israel. The Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean.

24
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,590
More from Barbara Plattuscher in Washington.

25
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,790
The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.

26
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:05,990
They're sending an aircraft carrier with a deck of warplanes accompanied by cruisers and destroyers, also extra military assistance, such as munitions.

27
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:14,610
In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the fight. It's backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas.

28
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:24,010
There are reports that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack, although the Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.

29
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,130
The U.N. Security Council has held an emergency closed-door session to discuss the crisis.

30
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,830
The U.N. Middle East envoy called on countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.

31
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,170
More from Neder Taufik in New York.

32
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,990
Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement. Not all, but many, condemned Hamas.

33
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:52,430
The UAE's ambassador to the U.N., Lana Nasebe, told reporters there was real concern that tensions in the region could become inflamed.

34
00:03:52,430 --> 00:04:00,650
Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan, showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.

35
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:08,630
The Palestinian U.N. ambassador, Riyadh Mansour, told reporters he'd requested an emergency meeting of Arab League states in Cairo.

36
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,690
The inquiry was set up by the British government after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.

37
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,990
The U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to China, has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

38
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,230
Mr. Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit, as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.

39
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:55,070
Regional elections in two of Germany's largest and wealthiest states, Bavaria and Hesse, have dealt a blow to the parties that form the center-left federal government.

40
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,850
Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats.

41
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,090
The Christian Democrats again emerge as the largest party.

42
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,950
The president of Ecuador has extended the state of emergency by 30 days.

43
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,770
It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Villarricencio.

44
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,130
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were found dead in prison.

45
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:30,130
A hoard of coins believed to have belonged to a Highland clan chief, who was murdered more than 300 years ago, has been found in Scotland.

46
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,110
Alexandra Mackenzie reports.

47
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,970
The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the first major excavation in Glencoe.

48
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,530
The dig focused on scattered rocks believed to have been the McDonald clan chief's summer house.

49
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:53,130
More than 300 years after he died in the Glencoe massacre, an archaeology student taking part in her first-ever dig found the hoard.

50
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,030
The University of Glasgow said the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins.

51
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:08,530
A number of other artefacts were also discovered at the site, including a musket and fouling shot, pottery from across Europe and a powder major.

52
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,450
BBC News

53
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:42,150
We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.

54
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:49,390
The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall, with more than 2,000 injured.

55
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:59,590
The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.

56
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:07,730
The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.

57
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:20,210
In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip, with more than 2,000 wounded, according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.

58
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,950
Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale destruction.

59
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:30,730
Shops are closed, the streets are empty, the city is said to be like a ghost town.

60
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:38,590
According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have not been displaced in Gaza because of the airstrikes.

61
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,950
And many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.

62
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,490
In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.

63
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:53,070
The last couple of days were harrowing, and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

64
00:07:54,070 --> 00:08:07,330
Gaza is a very highly-dense populated area with very limited geographical area, like with over 2 million people living in 360-kilometer squares,

65
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,510
which makes each and every missile drop very impactful and damaging.

66
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:20,430
The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing,

67
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,370
decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian land

68
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:33,470
and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.

69
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:44,230
Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians

70
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:54,190
refusing its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive,

71
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:04,210
and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison with restrictions on right to movement, right to health,

72
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,170
and many other associated basic rights.

73
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,670
Yet we were told as civilians to leave, I mean, leave and go where.

74
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,570
No crossings are open, neither the sea. That is also have restriction to some point.

75
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:26,790
If you trespass, you can be shot. For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed,

76
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,250
including women, children, elderly, and persons with disabilities.

77
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,470
I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school shelters

78
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:44,470
that not even fully prepared or accommodate these numbers and provide for their needs.

79
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:51,430
I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws and conflicts and its principles.

80
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,790
These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and civilians,

81
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:12,590
avoid disproportionate use of force, and have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies for the population.

82
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:25,830
And now there is limited electricity, and crossings are fully closed to let in any supplies.

83
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,630
But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles,

84
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:37,950
and the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.

85
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,730
A resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like.

86
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,850
And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com forward slash news.

87
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,390
There is a live page being updated as we get more news.

88
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,630
Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism,

89
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,290
a former member of the Knessetly Israeli parliament, Mikhail Kotler-Wunsch.

90
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,490
Thanks so much for joining us.

91
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,110
Thank you so much for having me on.

92
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,150
How are Israelis feeling today?

93
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:16,890
You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is,

94
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,770
it actually encourages me to ask you the question.

95
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,790
Because, you know, when I hear the framing of what is happening in Israel,

96
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,910
where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in Gaza

97
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:37,270
alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on Saturday morning

98
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:42,510
as we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel,

99
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:49,590
5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza,

100
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,670
each rocket a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.

101
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:04,450
When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260 at least young partygoers

102
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:12,150
on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the anti-Semitic terror organization Hamas

103
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:19,590
actually designated as a terror organization funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran

104
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:28,150
holding its own civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza, in the same way that ISIS,

105
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,910
in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West,

106
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:39,690
that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.

107
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,250
So I would turn the question to you if this were happening anywhere else in the world,

108
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,090
not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians,

109
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,930
but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians,

110
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:59,570
where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians

111
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:07,990
and holding families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip

112
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,910
of entire families being butchered in their homes

113
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:20,370
and to hear the way that the framing, that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel

114
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:25,670
of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.

115
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:33,770
Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives on this as we can.

116
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:40,090
I asked you how Israelis were feeling and I got a sense from you of the anger there is

117
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:46,190
and the sadness too. No, there is no anger. We are fighting for our lives. There is no anger. Let it be clear.

118
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:54,450
You said that this is like Israel's 9-11. Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?

119
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,590
It's not just because of this shock. It's because of the same modus operandi.

120
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:06,610
This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us at the moment.

121
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:13,470
Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that must defend its citizens from terror.

122
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,990
You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand what Israelis are feeling.

123
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:26,570
There is no both sides when a terror organization ravages civilian areas,

124
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,450
enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians,

125
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:38,490
breaking barriers, that there is a fence. There has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.

126
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,830
There has been a blockade though hasn't there of Gaza?

127
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:49,570
No, there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every day to work in Israel.

128
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,910
There are thousands of truckloads. There is electricity and water still being supplied.

129
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:00,270
Although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza because that's who was elected

130
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,450
to reign over Gaza and there is a responsibility of the international community

131
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:14,970
and of all those that cherish life and liberty to hold Hamas to account for holding those two million civilians in Gaza hostage to their war crimes

132
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,430
not only on Israel but on Gaza civilians.

133
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,230
How do you think the Israeli military should respond then?

134
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:25,490
We've seen a total of more than 500 air strikes over the weekend.

135
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,010
How do you think the Israeli military should, how do you think any other countries...

136
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,230
Well, my job is to ask questions and not answer them.

137
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:36,550
Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect its civilians when they're being attacked, including as we speak,

138
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:43,050
in their homes, including as we speak. There is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror.

139
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:52,150
This is not two countries fighting each other. A genocidal terror organization, ISIS if you will, 9-11, needs moral clarity.

140
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,330
And this is not just about Jews around the world who are now under attack.

141
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,870
Obviously, to my question then, how do you think the military should respond?

142
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:09,830
There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza, although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment.

143
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,010
Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government to go?

144
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:21,870
There are dozens of Israeli hostages and many of them are civilians that were abducted, many of them raped,

145
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,070
many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated.

146
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:36,730
And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must the citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak.

147
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:49,490
And every country that cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught, massacre of its civilians.

148
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,910
And those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization.

149
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:06,490
And I want to make it very clear alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers and two civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.

150
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:23,490
And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries must call for the immediate and unconditional return because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization, to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.

151
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:30,430
And what the IDF will have to do and the state of Israel will have to do in its existential war is not just about the state of Israel.

152
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,190
I want to make it very clear to your listeners.

153
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,690
Mikal Karkler-Vunch, we've got to leave it there. Thanks for joining us.

154
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,270
Well, same with this story and looking at the business side of things.

155
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:48,210
One industry that's already feeling the impact of this conflict is the aviation industry with dozens of flights already cancelled.

156
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:54,450
Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore, Kettie Silva. Kettie, what are we seeing?

157
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,810
Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines canceling flights.

158
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:04,850
The likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair all cancelled journeys.

159
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:13,950
British Airways, for its part, told the BBC that it's only cancelled one flight on Sunday and that it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days.

160
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:21,350
And that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport or if perhaps they want to land at different times of the day that may be deemed safer.

161
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:29,550
Many of these airlines are also offering passengers to cancel their flights or to move the dates with no sort of change fees.

162
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:36,010
Flights to Israel's second international airport, Iliad, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea, they've been unaffected.

163
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:47,470
But we've also heard that Israelis flag carrier LL. It's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now, but again, allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.

164
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:53,710
But this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying or desperately trying to leave.

165
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:05,630
To leave, well, as well as to get home. So that's one of the major issues is that many have found themselves stranded and with fears about whether or not the airspace will be closed.

166
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:12,610
So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there amongst them stranded in Cyprus at Lanukah International Airport late last night.

167
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,550
Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights home.

168
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,790
As I say, rumors about whether or not the country may close its airspace.

169
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:28,010
It was hard to get tickets, we understand. Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights.

170
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,110
And getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.

171
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:40,670
In terms of leaving the country, we've heard, for example, as well from Athens, the foreign ministry saying that it's working to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.

172
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,610
Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece.

173
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,650
But there is indeed much concern about many of the foreign workers in Israel.

174
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,370
I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel.

175
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:58,130
And so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home, if indeed they want to leave Israel.

176
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,830
All right, Katie Silver, always a pleasure to have you on the program.

177
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,230
Our business correspondent there in Singapore.

178
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:10,830
And we are remaining with this story, and we are now going to speak to our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.

179
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,330
Good morning to you, Jeremy. Now, you have called this a major Middle East crisis.

180
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,790
Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?

181
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:29,310
Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas has been able to break out of Gaza,

182
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:35,250
which is surrounded by, if you like, a ring of steel of fences, wire fences and concrete,

183
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:42,650
break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis, including many, many civilians.

184
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,530
That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before.

185
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:58,490
And it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma and plenty of people here compare it to the 9-11 attacks in the United States.

186
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:04,790
There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that if you adjust the death toll for population,

187
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,550
it's the equivalent of the Americans losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.

188
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:19,030
So it's a big, big event. And the Israeli response, which is going to be, is already very heavy military action,

189
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,570
but I think there'll be a land invasion, too, of Gaza.

190
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,390
Now, that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region.

191
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,330
So we're into really unexplored territory right now.

192
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,670
And Jeremy, you have been in the region, you have been in the area.

193
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:43,610
Just for our listeners' benefit, can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like and how that area is to Israel?

194
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:54,810
Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast, which is surrounded mostly by Israel,

195
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:01,530
but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.

196
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,910
The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.

197
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:16,830
Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948,

198
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,730
a time that the Palestinians call the Nakba, the catastrophe.

199
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,290
And it's an area where people are mostly very poor.

200
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,810
They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.

201
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,730
They're mostly not allowed to leave the area.

202
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,690
There are plenty of adults there who've never left.

203
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:44,110
And so it is a situation which is, life there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic.

204
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,790
And since 2007, it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas,

205
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,630
which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement.

206
00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:00,770
And you wrote a nice read on our website where you said that Hamas blindsided Israel

207
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,230
with what you called the most serious attack in a generation.

208
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:09,950
And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken, including civilians as well as soldiers.

209
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,790
What sort of challenge does this pose for the government of Mr Netanyahu and the army going forward?

210
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:23,090
It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government has, I think, faced probably for 50 years

211
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,750
since the 1973 Middle East war.

212
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:35,930
His political enemies are already blaming him, saying that he took his arf the ball for a variety of reasons.

213
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,030
It's clear that there's been from the Israeli perspective a huge intelligence failure

214
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,490
and they're struggling militarily to assert themselves.

215
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,290
They will succeed in doing that.

216
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,450
I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.

217
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:59,310
I think the big question, and this is probably an equal challenge for the Israelis,

218
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,910
is what happens after that?

219
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,390
What happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?

220
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,850
Because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza and finally pulled out in 2005

221
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,090
do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation.

222
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:24,290
But if they sent in their troops, there's going to have to be some kind of governance of a territory

223
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:30,750
which is maybe small, but as I said, contains getting on for two and a half million people.

224
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:36,170
Jeremy Bowen there. Thank you for coming on the programme. He is our international editor.

225
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,730
We're going to move away from our top story. We will return to it later on in the programme, though.

226
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,150
Isaac Fanon is here. He's going to give us some sports headlines.

227
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:53,770
Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goals, but they finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League.

228
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,290
Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th minute as City lost their second game

229
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,510
in the Premier League in a row for the first time. That's happened in five years.

230
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,490
European football's governing body, UEFA, has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel

231
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,150
during the next fortnight amid increased tensions in the region. Israel were due to play

232
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:17,810
Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv, but that game has been rescheduled

233
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,910
and UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days to see whether Israel's away

234
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,330
qualifier in Kosovo will still take place on the 15th of October.

235
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:33,570
To athletics news next, Kenyon Kelvin Kipton shattered the men's marathon world record in Chicago.

236
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,730
He beat his compatriot Ella Kichoga's previous mark by more than 30 seconds.

237
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,090
A 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours, 35 seconds.

238
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:51,010
And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal in the final pool stage match.

239
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:59,210
Fiji got a losing bonus point and they qualify at Australia's expense due to their 22-15 victory way back in September.

240
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,070
Isaac, thank you very much indeed.

241
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:08,450
Now, we are going to turn to Afghanistan because thousands of people in the west of the country

242
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:15,090
are spending a second night in the open after a strong earthquake on Saturday reduced entire villages to rubble.

243
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,990
There's been confusion about the number of dead with Taliban officials apologizing for an early assessment

244
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,870
that more than 2,000 people had died.

245
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:31,410
The United Nations Humanitarian Agency says that more than 1,000 have been killed and more than 500 are still missing.

246
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,270
I'm now joined by my colleague from the Afghan service, Angela Gair.

247
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:41,690
Good morning to you, Angela. What is the latest that you can tell us about this devastating event?

248
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:54,550
Good morning. The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is, actually, I can say that is a very, very, very big.

249
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:16,050
The darkest time that we are experiencing in Afghanistan, the number that the Taliban are trying to share with the media is very different than what we have receiving from the people.

250
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:30,630
I think in that area, we had more than 20 violence which are completely destroyed in the earthquake.

251
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:41,070
And also, there is no way in the first hour, when the Taliban tried to control the media, we didn't receive that.

252
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:54,930
Actually, we felt that everything is not that bad when we sent the volunteers group to the area.

253
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,190
Actually, I'm so sorry.

254
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:05,290
No, don't worry. Angela, basically, the Taliban have gone back to what they said, the numbers have changed.

255
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,250
But what are people saying on the ground, those who have been affected?

256
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:32,170
They don't accept the numbers which the Taliban is sharing, actually. And also, I think more than 2,000 people are killed, 1,000 people displaced, and 1,000 people are missing in this crisis.

257
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:45,570
And we have nothing at that moment. At this moment, there is no big, big offer or support from the Taliban for the people.

258
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:58,330
Just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help for the people and the volunteers group from a lot in other cities.

259
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:05,830
Thank you so much for coming on to the program, telling us about the devastating earthquake that has shaken Afghanistan in the west of the country.

260
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,930
This is Newsday on the BBC World Service with Robin Vick. Stay with us if you can.
