20460	29560	This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza.
29560	31420	We hear from a woman in Gaza.
32040	37440	The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.
38320	45020	Gaza's very highly-dense populated area with each and every missile very impactful and damaging.
45820	53140	In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival, the first site attacked by Hamas.
53140	60120	We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.
60820	67520	And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000 people. Rescue efforts are continuing.
67820	69900	But first, we're getting a bulletin of World News.
73730	77010	This is Danielle Yawovieczka with the BBC News. Hello.
77010	85570	The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over 500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

115150	124070	But most believe this is just the beginning. Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000 army reservists.
124070	133170	Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion, with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

150090	156590	Three U.S. air carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended flights to Tel Aviv.
158090	167570	The United States says it's sending immediate extra munitions to Israel. The Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean.
168350	170590	More from Barbara Plattuscher in Washington.
170950	177790	The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.
177790	185990	They're sending an aircraft carrier with a deck of warplanes accompanied by cruisers and destroyers, also extra military assistance, such as munitions.
186610	194610	In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the fight. It's backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas.
195490	204010	There are reports that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack, although the Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.

295830	300850	Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats.
301390	304090	The Christian Democrats again emerge as the largest party.

310310	316770	It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Villarricencio.

323630	330130	A hoard of coins believed to have belonged to a Highland clan chief, who was murdered more than 300 years ago, has been found in Scotland.
330870	332110	Alexandra Mackenzie reports.
332790	338970	The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the first major excavation in Glencoe.
339290	344530	The dig focused on scattered rocks believed to have been the McDonald clan chief's summer house.
344810	353130	More than 300 years after he died in the Glencoe massacre, an archaeology student taking part in her first-ever dig found the hoard.
353530	359030	The University of Glasgow said the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins.
359030	368530	A number of other artefacts were also discovered at the site, including a musket and fouling shot, pottery from across Europe and a powder major.
369450	370450	BBC News
394470	402150	We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.
402450	409390	The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall, with more than 2,000 injured.
409590	419590	The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.
419590	427730	The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.
428250	440210	In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip, with more than 2,000 wounded, according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.
440850	444950	Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale destruction.
444950	450730	Shops are closed, the streets are empty, the city is said to be like a ghost town.
451370	458590	According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have not been displaced in Gaza because of the airstrikes.
458990	462950	And many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.
463130	466490	In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.
466490	473070	The last couple of days were harrowing, and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.
474070	487330	Gaza is a very highly-dense populated area with very limited geographical area, like with over 2 million people living in 360-kilometer squares,
487930	492510	which makes each and every missile drop very impactful and damaging.
492510	500430	The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing,
500970	506370	decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian land
506370	513470	and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.
514470	524230	Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians
526710	534190	refusing its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive,
534190	544210	and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison with restrictions on right to movement, right to health,
544310	547170	and many other associated basic rights.
547510	552670	Yet we were told as civilians to leave, I mean, leave and go where.
553790	559570	No crossings are open, neither the sea. That is also have restriction to some point.
559570	566790	If you trespass, you can be shot. For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed,
566990	571250	including women, children, elderly, and persons with disabilities.
571510	576470	I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school shelters
576470	584470	that not even fully prepared or accommodate these numbers and provide for their needs.
584470	591430	I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws and conflicts and its principles.
591710	597790	These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and civilians,
598190	612590	avoid disproportionate use of force, and have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies for the population.
612590	625830	And now there is limited electricity, and crossings are fully closed to let in any supplies.
626770	630630	But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles,
631070	637950	and the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.
638630	643730	A resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like.
643850	648850	And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com forward slash news.
648850	652390	There is a live page being updated as we get more news.
652870	658630	Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism,
658930	663290	a former member of the Knessetly Israeli parliament, Mikhail Kotler-Wunsch.
663330	664490	Thanks so much for joining us.
665650	667110	Thank you so much for having me on.
667110	669150	How are Israelis feeling today?
670650	676890	You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is,
677790	680770	it actually encourages me to ask you the question.
680990	685790	Because, you know, when I hear the framing of what is happening in Israel,
686370	691910	where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in Gaza
691910	697270	alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on Saturday morning
697270	702510	as we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel,
703030	709590	5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza,
709950	714670	each rocket a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.
714670	724450	When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260 at least young partygoers
724450	732150	on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the anti-Semitic terror organization Hamas
732670	739590	actually designated as a terror organization funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran
739590	748150	holding its own civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza, in the same way that ISIS,
748370	751910	in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West,
752430	759690	that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.
760050	764250	So I would turn the question to you if this were happening anywhere else in the world,
764510	768090	not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians,
768090	771930	but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians,
772250	779570	where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians
780090	787990	and holding families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip
787990	791910	of entire families being butchered in their homes
791910	800370	and to hear the way that the framing, that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel
800370	805670	of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.
806110	813770	Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives on this as we can.
813970	820090	I asked you how Israelis were feeling and I got a sense from you of the anger there is
820090	826190	and the sadness too. No, there is no anger. We are fighting for our lives. There is no anger. Let it be clear.
826830	834450	You said that this is like Israel's 9-11. Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?
835290	839590	It's not just because of this shock. It's because of the same modus operandi.
840170	846610	This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us at the moment.
846610	853470	Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that must defend its citizens from terror.
854110	859990	You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand what Israelis are feeling.
860370	866570	There is no both sides when a terror organization ravages civilian areas,
867010	871450	enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians,
871450	878490	breaking barriers, that there is a fence. There has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.
879230	881830	There has been a blockade though hasn't there of Gaza?
881910	889570	No, there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every day to work in Israel.
890210	894910	There are thousands of truckloads. There is electricity and water still being supplied.
895090	900270	Although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza because that's who was elected
900270	905450	to reign over Gaza and there is a responsibility of the international community
905450	914970	and of all those that cherish life and liberty to hold Hamas to account for holding those two million civilians in Gaza hostage to their war crimes
914970	917430	not only on Israel but on Gaza civilians.
918130	920230	How do you think the Israeli military should respond then?
920350	925490	We've seen a total of more than 500 air strikes over the weekend.
925510	928010	How do you think the Israeli military should, how do you think any other countries...
928010	930230	Well, my job is to ask questions and not answer them.
930810	936550	Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect its civilians when they're being attacked, including as we speak,
937170	943050	in their homes, including as we speak. There is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror.
943590	952150	This is not two countries fighting each other. A genocidal terror organization, ISIS if you will, 9-11, needs moral clarity.
952550	956330	And this is not just about Jews around the world who are now under attack.
956330	958870	Obviously, to my question then, how do you think the military should respond?
959010	969830	There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza, although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment.
970250	974010	Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government to go?
974750	981870	There are dozens of Israeli hostages and many of them are civilians that were abducted, many of them raped,
981870	986070	many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated.
987070	996730	And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must the citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak.
997690	1009490	And every country that cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught, massacre of its civilians.
1009490	1013910	And those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization.
1014090	1026490	And I want to make it very clear alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers and two civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.
1026490	1043490	And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries must call for the immediate and unconditional return because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization, to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.
1043990	1050430	And what the IDF will have to do and the state of Israel will have to do in its existential war is not just about the state of Israel.
1050570	1052190	I want to make it very clear to your listeners.
1052190	1055690	Mikal Karkler-Vunch, we've got to leave it there. Thanks for joining us.
1056690	1060270	Well, same with this story and looking at the business side of things.
1060410	1068210	One industry that's already feeling the impact of this conflict is the aviation industry with dozens of flights already cancelled.
1068750	1074450	Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore, Kettie Silva. Kettie, what are we seeing?
1075610	1078810	Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines canceling flights.
1079070	1084850	The likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair all cancelled journeys.
1085390	1093950	British Airways, for its part, told the BBC that it's only cancelled one flight on Sunday and that it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days.
1094110	1101350	And that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport or if perhaps they want to land at different times of the day that may be deemed safer.
1101350	1109550	Many of these airlines are also offering passengers to cancel their flights or to move the dates with no sort of change fees.
1110670	1116010	Flights to Israel's second international airport, Iliad, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea, they've been unaffected.
1116490	1127470	But we've also heard that Israelis flag carrier LL. It's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now, but again, allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.
1127470	1133710	But this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying or desperately trying to leave.
1135210	1145630	To leave, well, as well as to get home. So that's one of the major issues is that many have found themselves stranded and with fears about whether or not the airspace will be closed.
1145990	1152610	So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there amongst them stranded in Cyprus at Lanukah International Airport late last night.
1153310	1157550	Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights home.
1158230	1161790	As I say, rumors about whether or not the country may close its airspace.
1162350	1168010	It was hard to get tickets, we understand. Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights.
1168770	1171110	And getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.
1171550	1180670	In terms of leaving the country, we've heard, for example, as well from Athens, the foreign ministry saying that it's working to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.
1180670	1184610	Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece.
1184890	1189650	But there is indeed much concern about many of the foreign workers in Israel.
1189830	1193370	I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel.
1193570	1198130	And so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home, if indeed they want to leave Israel.
1198690	1201830	All right, Katie Silver, always a pleasure to have you on the program.
1201990	1204230	Our business correspondent there in Singapore.
1204230	1210830	And we are remaining with this story, and we are now going to speak to our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
1211130	1216330	Good morning to you, Jeremy. Now, you have called this a major Middle East crisis.
1216810	1218790	Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?
1219970	1229310	Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas has been able to break out of Gaza,
1229310	1235250	which is surrounded by, if you like, a ring of steel of fences, wire fences and concrete,
1236110	1242650	break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis, including many, many civilians.
1243470	1247530	That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before.
1248430	1258490	And it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma and plenty of people here compare it to the 9-11 attacks in the United States.
1258490	1264790	There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that if you adjust the death toll for population,
1264790	1269550	it's the equivalent of the Americans losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.
1269850	1279030	So it's a big, big event. And the Israeli response, which is going to be, is already very heavy military action,
1279070	1282570	but I think there'll be a land invasion, too, of Gaza.
1282570	1288390	Now, that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region.
1289050	1292330	So we're into really unexplored territory right now.
1293230	1296670	And Jeremy, you have been in the region, you have been in the area.
1296930	1303610	Just for our listeners' benefit, can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like and how that area is to Israel?
1305590	1314810	Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast, which is surrounded mostly by Israel,
1316390	1321530	but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.
1323190	1328910	The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.
1328910	1336830	Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948,
1336830	1340730	a time that the Palestinians call the Nakba, the catastrophe.
1341890	1345290	And it's an area where people are mostly very poor.
1345490	1348810	They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.
1349150	1351730	They're mostly not allowed to leave the area.
1352290	1355690	There are plenty of adults there who've never left.
1355690	1364110	And so it is a situation which is, life there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic.
1364390	1369790	And since 2007, it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas,
1370010	1373630	which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement.
1374330	1380770	And you wrote a nice read on our website where you said that Hamas blindsided Israel
1380770	1384230	with what you called the most serious attack in a generation.
1384230	1389950	And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken, including civilians as well as soldiers.
1390590	1395790	What sort of challenge does this pose for the government of Mr Netanyahu and the army going forward?
1397130	1403090	It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government has, I think, faced probably for 50 years
1403090	1405750	since the 1973 Middle East war.
1408310	1415930	His political enemies are already blaming him, saying that he took his arf the ball for a variety of reasons.
1416990	1421030	It's clear that there's been from the Israeli perspective a huge intelligence failure
1421030	1424490	and they're struggling militarily to assert themselves.
1424650	1426290	They will succeed in doing that.
1426430	1430450	I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.
1430450	1439310	I think the big question, and this is probably an equal challenge for the Israelis,
1440010	1441910	is what happens after that?
1444010	1447390	What happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?
1447750	1453850	Because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza and finally pulled out in 2005
1455230	1458090	do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation.
1458090	1464290	But if they sent in their troops, there's going to have to be some kind of governance of a territory
1464290	1470750	which is maybe small, but as I said, contains getting on for two and a half million people.
1471930	1476170	Jeremy Bowen there. Thank you for coming on the programme. He is our international editor.
1483190	1486730	We're going to move away from our top story. We will return to it later on in the programme, though.

1489150	1493770	Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goals, but they finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League.

1503270	1507490	European football's governing body, UEFA, has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel
1507490	1512150	during the next fortnight amid increased tensions in the region. Israel were due to play

1517810	1522910	and UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days to see whether Israel's away
1522910	1527330	qualifier in Kosovo will still take place on the 15th of October.

1543090	1551010	And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal in the final pool stage match.
1551270	1559210	Fiji got a losing bonus point and they qualify at Australia's expense due to their 22-15 victory way back in September.
1559970	1561070	Isaac, thank you very much indeed.
1562110	1568450	Now, we are going to turn to Afghanistan because thousands of people in the west of the country
1568450	1575090	are spending a second night in the open after a strong earthquake on Saturday reduced entire villages to rubble.
1575570	1580990	There's been confusion about the number of dead with Taliban officials apologizing for an early assessment
1580990	1583870	that more than 2,000 people had died.
1584150	1591410	The United Nations Humanitarian Agency says that more than 1,000 have been killed and more than 500 are still missing.
1591850	1596270	I'm now joined by my colleague from the Afghan service, Angela Gair.
1596270	1601690	Good morning to you, Angela. What is the latest that you can tell us about this devastating event?
1602950	1614550	Good morning. The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is, actually, I can say that is a very, very, very big.
1619010	1636050	The darkest time that we are experiencing in Afghanistan, the number that the Taliban are trying to share with the media is very different than what we have receiving from the people.
1636050	1650630	I think in that area, we had more than 20 violence which are completely destroyed in the earthquake.
1650630	1661070	And also, there is no way in the first hour, when the Taliban tried to control the media, we didn't receive that.
1661370	1674930	Actually, we felt that everything is not that bad when we sent the volunteers group to the area.
1675730	1678190	Actually, I'm so sorry.
1679170	1685290	No, don't worry. Angela, basically, the Taliban have gone back to what they said, the numbers have changed.
1685530	1689250	But what are people saying on the ground, those who have been affected?
1690490	1712170	They don't accept the numbers which the Taliban is sharing, actually. And also, I think more than 2,000 people are killed, 1,000 people displaced, and 1,000 people are missing in this crisis.
1712170	1725570	And we have nothing at that moment. At this moment, there is no big, big offer or support from the Taliban for the people.
1726970	1738330	Just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help for the people and the volunteers group from a lot in other cities.
1738330	1745830	Thank you so much for coming on to the program, telling us about the devastating earthquake that has shaken Afghanistan in the west of the country.
