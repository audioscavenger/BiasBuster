20200	25080	Israel is responding to Hamas' surprise attacks at the weekend with a series of airstrikes
25080	25640	in Gaza.
25900	29180	Palestinian health officials say more than 400 people have been killed.
29460	34160	Israel says that more than 700 of its citizens have died in the attacks so far, we get the
34160	35400	latest from both sides.

45940	51380	The Israeli military has said its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over
51380	54500	500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.
55060	60200	Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside
60200	64460	Israel two days after they carried out a devastating mass assault.
64940	67780	More than 700 Israelis have been killed.
68240	73740	Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes before
73740	74880	the latest barrage.
75800	80660	Hamas said it had fired missiles targeting Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.
81300	86700	Three U.S. air carriers as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates have suspended services
86700	90900	to Tel Aviv, but some evacuation flights have taken place from the airport.
91480	96600	The UN Security Council has held an emergency meeting in New York to discuss the crisis behind
96600	97300	closed doors.
97780	102680	The UN Middle East envoy called on all countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.
104280	109740	In other news, an independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into allegations
109740	115020	that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan between
115020	116640	2010 and 2013.
117180	121360	The inquiry was set up after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.
122640	128100	The U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is leading a bipartisan delegation to China,
128540	130300	has met the foreign minister Wang Yi.
130760	135260	Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit as Washington seeks to
135260	137180	ease tensions with Beijing.
137800	141540	Mr Wang said he hoped the visit would help the U.S. to view its relationship with
141540	143620	China in a more objective way.
144680	148640	In Ecuador, the state of emergency has been extended by 30 days.
149080	152880	It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential
152880	155100	candidate Fernando Villavicencio.
155580	159540	The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were
159540	160380	found dead in prison.
161080	162020	BBC News.
192940	197960	We start this half hour of the programme with the latest developments in Gaza and Israel.
198220	202480	It is now two days since Hamas militants launched a wave of attacks against Israel.
202480	208020	Hamas runs Gaza, where more than two million Palestinians live, and Hamas is also designated
208020	211020	as a terror group by much of the Western world.
211640	213720	The death toll continues to rise.
214040	217480	700 Israelis have been killed and over 2,000 injured.
217960	222240	In retaliation, Israel has launched air strikes on the Gaza Strip, which have killed at least
223540	228940	413 people, and battles are continuing inside Israel between the Israeli Defence
228940	231160	Forces and Hamas fighters.
231160	235480	For the latest, I've been talking to a spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces,
235980	237000	Masha Mickelson.
237120	240760	And I asked if there are still fighters in Israel at the moment.
241360	242480	Yes, there are.
243060	247280	There's fighting still going on in several points in the community surrounding the Gaza
247280	254060	Strip. We're talking about Bari, Raim, Kfar Azad, the Zikim military base.
254060	261440	There's ongoing combat, and it's something that takes hours, multiple hours, to clear
261440	263000	those terrorists out.
263440	267980	And the idea is focusing right now on getting the southern part of Israel back to normal
267980	270220	without terrorists on Israeli soil.
270380	272400	How long do you think it will take to get it back to normal?
273480	274540	It's hard to say.
274700	279460	We hoped we would be in a better situation by the end of yesterday,
279500	281540	but there's still fighting going on.
281540	285860	This is our main objective throughout the day, to save as many lives as possible,
286480	290520	and get the terrorists out of Israel, whatever it takes.
291800	297020	While we're doing that, IDF aircraft are striking in Gaza hundreds of military
297020	298500	Hamas terrorist targets.
301160	309760	We have seen around 880 targets that have been struck, including terror tunnels.
311080	316520	That's, of course, in response to over 3,300 rockets that were fired from the Gaza Strip
316520	318340	in addition to the invasion.
318580	321040	I'm going to come back to the airstrikes in just a moment.
321420	325120	Do you know whether there are still Hamas fighters entering Israel,
325260	329180	or is that boundary between Israel and the Gaza Strip secure?
331380	335360	There are Hamas people trying to infiltrate Israel.
335360	340020	Yes, still as we speak, they're being met with fire from IDF UAVs that are
340020	341500	surveilling the area of the border.
342080	344340	When they entered two days ago in the morning,
345080	348280	they blew up significant parts of the fence.
348740	353540	So there are still breached points of the fence that we are securing through the year.
353960	359440	Do you know how many people have been abducted and taken from Israel to Gaza?
360400	363160	We don't have the exact numbers, but it's in the dozens.
363160	367620	Right. We spoke to one family an hour ago on this program.
368000	373380	They think that five members of their family, including an eight-year-old girl, have been taken.
374220	377340	And they contacted us because they were worried that the authorities were not doing
377340	380580	all they could to try to secure their return.
381320	384640	If you don't know exactly how many people have been taken,
384840	388680	do you have any idea where these people are and what are you intending to do
388680	390120	to try to secure their release?
391080	398840	We've seen documentation of hostages being held in Gaza in apartments and basements.
399300	402980	They're spread through multiple locations as far as we know.
403840	410580	The top officers in the military are currently presenting the political echelon
410580	415480	in the security cabinet for the past two days with plausible military options to go forward.
415980	420700	And of course, the hostages and their possible locations are being taken into account
421360	423840	as we decide what our next step is.
424080	428920	Israel is a state that holds human life sacred and we will do everything in our power
429680	432820	to ensure that they're coming back home safe.
433280	434520	But this is who Hamas is.
434700	438760	For years, they have been saying that this is their goal to eliminate the Jewish state,
438900	441940	to kill as many Jewish people as possible, to kidnap Jewish people.
442800	446280	And 48 hours ago, they showed their true face to the world.
447060	448720	Let's talk about the airstrikes.
449120	455560	You said that Hamas targets and tunnels that allow Hamas fighters to get from Gaza into Israel
455560	461980	have been hit by airstrikes, but also residential tower blocks have and mosques as well.
462340	467340	And we hear that more than 400 people have been killed, including children.
467780	473860	So Palestinian civilians are being killed and injured in these airstrikes, aren't they?
475320	482280	We're at war. The IDF targets, military targets that are used by Hamas.
482520	490320	Now, if Hamas treats their civilians for years as human shields, hiding ammunition
490320	494640	storages, hiding rocket launchers beneath schools, beneath mosques,
494640	500460	beneath UN facilities and kindergartens, we've seen how they treat Israeli citizens that they have
500460	505180	kidnapped. The IDF strikes targets that we have intelligence on that are being used by
505180	510360	Hamas for terrorism. And the way that Hamas acts is entrenching themselves cynically
510960	516300	within civilian population to make these actions more complicated for the IDF.
516400	518280	Of course, we are aware of that, but we are at war.
519000	524100	Masha Mickelson, the spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces, and I mentioned a family
524700	531460	in that interview, too, that IDF spokesperson who are waiting for news on five relatives who
531460	536900	have been abducted by Hamas fighters. We're going to play the interview with one of
536900	538420	those family members later on in the program.
538980	543500	Well, the number of Palestinians killed in the violence has also continued to rise.
543500	549620	Health officials in Gaza said there is more than 400 deaths so far, and over 2,000 people
549620	555180	have been injured, as Israel launches more air strikes on the territory. The Israeli air force
555180	559960	says that it struck over 500 terrorist targets in Gaza overnight.
560300	563900	Well, for more, we are now joined by Professor Lina Katibi, who is the director
563900	569820	of the Middle East Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies University here
569820	573360	in London. Good morning to you and welcome to Newsday.
573900	579700	In your opinion, why do you think Hamas militants launched the operation in the first place?
581960	588860	The main reason is, of course, to try to put an end to the Israeli occupation that has been
588860	595760	going on for many, many, many years. The situation in Gaza in particular is really
595760	602900	very tough. It's been under siege for almost two decades, and Hamas wants to present itself
602900	607640	to the Palestinians as the entity that can make a difference in that regard.
608120	613800	So we have to remember here that the main goal for Hamas is political behind this military
613800	621180	operation. It's not to just call short-term destabilization. It's actually to say this is
621180	632500	a game-changing attack that puts Hamas as the central Palestinian entity for the world to kind of
632500	638580	engage with. But then one would wonder with this attack and seeing so many Palestinians dead and
638580	645580	obviously the ongoing fighting is still on. How much support does that leave Hamas
645580	647880	where we're in Gaza and among Palestinians?
648600	656100	Actually Hamas now enjoys wide support for this attack. People are very aware of the high price
656100	662820	that will be paid because of course Israel's retaliation is not going to be mild. And yet
662820	670360	they are so desperate that they feel they have nothing to lose. So that's why you're seeing
670360	677560	not just in Gaza but even wider in the Arab world a lot of support expressed for Hamas.
678520	686500	I think the Israel-Palestine conflict had been ignored for so long internationally that people
686500	691200	feel desperate measures are needed. And you said that there's even more wide
691200	697020	support for Hamas in the region as such. But looking at all that, we're not only
697020	702280	talking about infrastructures. There are lives and people who are being killed and injured and some
702280	709460	will be probably hostages. I wonder then in your opinion where does this go? How does this get
709460	717320	solved if anyone at all? The only way to resolve the situation is to resolve the Israel-Palestine
717320	723260	conflict. I mean without the conflict having been protracted for many many years,
723260	729620	Hamas would not have existed in the first place. I mean we have to remember in the 70s and 80s,
729620	737540	early 80s there was no Hamas. It was Fatah, the PLO and some other groups. But Hamas is a
737540	744080	relative newcomer in the history of the conflict and a product of the kind of stagnation
744080	749520	of this conflict politically. So the only way to resolve this is to go back to politics
749520	758080	and find a solution that is acceptable to Palestinians. I think you know these kinds of
758080	765120	groups like Hamas basically find an opening in protracted conflict and try to assert themselves
765920	772040	as a result. So we need the US back on track, we need the UK, we need the international community
772040	777720	at large to take this conflict seriously. We've already seen regional actors like Saudi Arabia
777720	784160	saying they are serious about wanting to find a solution to this conflict as well. So I think
784680	791160	this is the only way out. It's not about a military victory for anybody. It has to be
791160	796040	a political solution that restores peace. And briefly if you may, where does this leave
796040	800960	then the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in those conversations about a solution?
802260	809580	One of the things that is being achieved also by Hamas in this attack is to show
809580	816060	the weakness of the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas. I think he's going to face
816060	823920	increasing criticism from Palestinians about the failures of his leadership. And it is likely that
824740	831080	in the aftermath of this attack, the Palestinian Authority will seek to find another leader
831590	837420	to replace Abbas, although it's not clear who that leader could be because there has not been a clear
837420	842700	succession plan. But definitely something needs to change in that regard as well.
842980	846940	Professor Lina Khatib, thank you for coming on to the program. She is the director of the
846940	852540	Middle East Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies University here in London.
852540	857880	Well, aid and refugee groups are already warning that civilians on both sides have paid and will
857880	864580	continue to pay the heaviest price. More than 123,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza so far,
865000	869960	with close to 74,000 seeking shelter in schools, according to the United Nations.
870120	875440	Well, on the line now from Jerusalem is Shayna Lowe of the Norwegian Refugee Council.
875780	879980	Welcome to Newsday, Shayna. What are your teams on the ground telling you?
879980	889640	Good morning. Yes, I just spoke to my colleague in Gaza about an hour ago. Last night was a
889640	894960	terrifying night full of bombardments. My colleague Yusef has two young children,
895460	900200	and they are doing all that they can to protect their children, distract them from what's going
900200	907540	on outside their windows. The night for them is, of course, the scariest time of day because
907540	912460	they just do not know what will happen, and it's when Israeli airstrikes really ramp up.
913000	920060	In terms of our ability to operate on the ground in Gaza, we can't right now. Our staff has been
920060	925200	told to shelter in place and take care of themselves and their families. And so we're
925200	929640	desperately waiting for a cessation of the hostilities in order for our staff to be
929640	934840	able to go out and assess the damage and provide needs and provide assistance
935560	942180	to those who are in need. So even as the UN says more than 120,000 Palestinians currently don't
942180	948960	have a home, you're unable to help them? Exactly. I mean, so long as there's
950440	955820	ongoing hostilities, we cannot, in good conscience, we have a duty of care to our staff,
957580	963040	and we cannot send them out to go and provide assistance until we know that they can reach
963040	967560	communities safely. Right. I see. What are you hearing from your team in Israel?
968700	976360	Well, we actually don't operate in Israel. We operate only in occupied Palestinian territory,
976360	982000	so that includes the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and then also in the Gaza Strip.
982240	989880	Right. Now, we know that the food situation was already stretched in Gaza before
990880	997620	Saturday's events. What is your message to the international community about the kinds of help
998200	1002160	that is needed, and what is the likelihood that that help will be able to get through?
1002960	1007640	Yeah. I mean, we need to have demands from the international community to call for,
1007820	1012540	if not a cessation of the hostilities, at least a pause in which humanitarian actors
1012540	1020300	can access Gaza and provide assistance. I understand that yesterday the crossing with
1020300	1026500	Egypt was open and that some truckloads of food came in, but the reality in Gaza is that food
1026500	1033180	supplies are always very short. There's not a lot of extra food that is stockpiled there,
1033440	1037800	and so we, of course, are calling for a cessation of the hostilities so that
1037800	1043760	the international community, humanitarian organizations can bring in additional supplies
1044360	1049020	for Palestinians in need. We heard from a spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces
1049020	1053600	earlier on the program who was clear that if there is a location where they believe there is a
1053600	1059760	Hamas fighter or leader, they will target that location. So what is your message to civilians
1059760	1064240	in Gaza about whether they're at home or if they're displaced, but what they should do,
1064240	1069540	where they should go? I mean, the reality is that there is no safe place in Gaza.
1070000	1076040	For 16 years, Gaza has been besieged. Palestinians living there have very little ability to get
1076040	1083220	out or move. It's one of the most densely populated places on earth. 2.2 million people
1083220	1090200	are living there. And so when we hear remarks from Benjamin Netanyahu calling for Palestinians
1090200	1096700	in Gaza to leave, our question is, where should they go? Because Israel controls
1097760	1104740	people's exit from the Gaza Strip into Israel. Yes, exactly. And the Egyptian border,
1104920	1111000	my understanding is that it was open yesterday. For people to leave or not, do you know?
1111440	1118220	Well, people can leave, but it's cost prohibitive. So the Egyptian authorities
1118940	1125620	control the cost of exiting into Egypt. And my understanding is that they have increased that
1125620	1132260	cost considerably. And there are limitations in terms of the capacity that they have at this time
1132260	1136840	to be letting people flee for safety. All right. Thanks very much. That's
1136840	1141380	Shayna Lowe there from the Norwegian Refugee Council, who was on the line from Jerusalem.
1141380	1146200	And joining us back in the studio is Isaac Fennin with All This Fool.
1148540	1154260	Arsenal got a massive 1-0 win over Manchester City in the Premier League. Gabriela Martinelli
1154260	1159920	scoring the win. It was Ghana's first win in City in the League since 2015. Here's their manager,
1160380	1166720	Miquel Arteta. It's been a long time since the club hasn't beat Man City. And we discussed
1166720	1171080	that a lot. And we felt like today could be the day, but we needed a big performance,
1171440	1176360	huge individual performances. And we had that. And with a bit of luck, we managed to win the game.
1176800	1181320	For City, it's two defeats in the row in the Premier League for the first time in five years.
1181480	1184240	But manager Pep Guardiola says it's not the time to panic.
1184680	1188660	We're in October. People say, OK, this year is not going to happen. We're not going to
1188660	1193040	win the Premier League four times in a row. Listen, no team in all history have won
1193040	1198520	four times in a row. But we are in October. And from experience as a manager, this is a long,
1198680	1203200	long road. European football's governing body UEFA has postponed. All matches scheduled
1203200	1207260	in Israel during the next fortnight amid increased tension in the region.
1207820	1213980	Israel were due to play Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv. But that game has
1213980	1218520	been rescheduled. And UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days to see
1218520	1224400	whether Israel's European championship qualifier in Kosovo can take place in October.
1225240	1231380	Simone Biles secured another two gold medals at the World Gymnastics Championships. Her 22nd
1231380	1236920	and 23rd, she won the beam and four titles to add to the team. And all around success
1236920	1243240	earlier on in the competition, she's got four gold medals on her return to the sport. She
1243240	1247820	is the most decorated gymnast in the sports history. And she's done all this,
1248060	1252800	having taken some time off after the Tokyo Olympics to focus on her mental health.
1253120	1256640	It hasn't been easy. I've been focusing a lot on my gymnastics and my mental,
1256960	1261040	going to therapy, making sure that's in my regular scheduled routine as of anything else.
1261160	1264320	But I'm really proud of the work that I put in because at the beginning of the year, I
1264320	1268320	wasn't sure I was going to be competing. And I actually wasn't supposed to be competing.
1268320	1271600	So to end up here now at Worlds at the end of the year, it's just like,
1271740	1273280	I just keep amazing myself.
1273700	1279740	There was a huge result in the Rugby World Cup as Portugal beat Fiji 24-23
1279740	1285740	to claim their first ever win at their first ever World Cup. Here's their player, Nicholas Martin.
1286340	1293420	Something incredible. I work a lot for that. I have nowhere to say that it's historic.
1293420	1297600	I'm so happy. I think it's the best moment of my life.
1297800	1306960	We are a team of friends from France, from Portugal, but we live together. It's something incredible.
1307500	1311160	Now despite their second loss of the group phase, Fiji are still
1311160	1316320	through to the quarter-finals. They will play England next weekend in Marseille.
1316680	1321540	And finally, Kenyon, Kelvin, Kiptum shattered the men's marathon world record
1321540	1325680	in Chicago as he beat Kampatria-Ellid, Kipchoge's previous mark
1325680	1332140	by more than 30 seconds. The 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours and 35 seconds.
1335940	1341280	Isaac Fennin, thank you so much for that news about the sporting world. Now this is news there
1341280	1346940	with Vic and Rob in other news this morning. An independent inquiry in the UK will begin
1346940	1353180	hearings today into allegations that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians
1353180	1360360	in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2013. The inquiry was set up after legal action was brought by two
1360360	1366080	Afghan families. The US state majority leader, Chuck Schumer, who is leading a bipartisan
1366080	1371900	delegation to China, has met with the foreign minister Wang Yi. Mr. Schumer is the latest high
1371900	1378040	level American official to visit as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing. Mr. Wang said
1378040	1384020	he hoped that the visit would help the US to view its relationship with China in a more objective
1384020	1390940	way. And in Ecuador, the state of emergency has been extended by 30 days. It's been in place
1390940	1396320	since the assassination in August of anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Vila Citencio.
1396320	1402200	The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing who are found dead in
1402200	1408280	prison. Now we're going to return to our main story now. It is more than 48 hours after Saturday's
1408280	1414540	unprecedented assault by fighters belonging to Hamas, which is designated as a terror organization by
1414540	1421280	Wani Western nations on Israel. And Hamas claims to have abducted more than 100 Israelis
1421280	1427220	with many taken over the boundary from Israel into Gaza. Some of them are believed to be Israeli
1427220	1432720	soldiers and many are civilians. Well, we've been contacted by a family anxious to know about the
1432720	1438020	fate of their five relatives who've been taken away from the Kibbutz of Nahos, which is a few
1438020	1444300	kilometers from Gaza. And I spoke on Sunday night to Yadin, who told me more about her missing
1444300	1450120	relatives. And she says she watched a Facebook live video in which she could see them being
1450120	1454660	taken, she thought, across the boundary into Gaza by these abductors.
1480220	1487360	If people didn't open the door and listen to them, they just shut the door and shut the people
1487360	1493620	whichever they want and took the rest in captivity. We don't know if they took them
1493620	1498800	across the border or just leave them there. We have no idea. And you could see all of this on
1498800	1507500	the video on Facebook. Yeah, it's 30 minutes live. Other than that, we just lost contact. So
1507500	1513940	there is no service or anything you can reach them. They are two little kids, two little daughters
1513940	1520020	of the partner who we don't know where they are. If they are together, if somebody is taking care
1520020	1527400	of them, there is another child who is 17 years old. It's a frightening situation. You said that
1527400	1532240	your aunt's partner appeared to have been shot in the leg. Was it clear from the video
1532240	1537460	whether he'd been given any medical care and how did the others in the video look?
1538160	1548120	One of the many videos that we saw is we saw Noam, the aunt's partner taking people of the
1548120	1554180	Hamas, is helping him walk through the border. Like for a two second shot, you could see it.
1554980	1561120	Other than that, we don't know anything. We just saw him walking very poorly.
1561780	1567360	How does that make you feel knowing that they've been taken or suspecting they've been taken to Gaza?
1568540	1575400	Terrible. All I can think is why the hell should I know they are being kept in Gaza via
1576240	1582880	channel Instagram. Presumably you've called your aunt's phone. Does it ring? Does anybody answer?
1584660	1594520	Actually, at the beginning, when some people try to text her, the Hamas answered the phone and wrote
1594520	1602000	in English. But other than that, when we try to call now, there is no line. You don't reach
1602000	1606980	to anything. It's ringing, but nobody answered. Have you spoken to the police? Have you spoken
1606980	1613880	to people in the army? We try. Even during the library, we call the authorities and they all say
1613880	1620460	they are aware of the problem and they really don't have something to do right now. It is a chaos.
1620800	1626600	It is really a chaos. It was a chaos. It's still a chaos. People don't know how to manage.
1627280	1631880	It was really a surprise attack. People don't know how to manage the situation.
1632480	1636880	What do you and the rest of the family want the authorities to do when it comes to your
1636880	1643640	aunt's partner and his children? We want to bring them home safe, no matter what the price is.
1644080	1652040	I think we all, the toll they took from us, we have 700 people killed,
1652460	1663560	thousands of people injured, not several injured, wounded very hard. It's not supposed to be in
1663560	1667640	civilians' people. Civilians shouldn't be paying this price.
1668000	1672700	Your family is clearly going through a very worrying, harrowing time at the moment.
1673080	1679460	What is it like being an Israeli right now? It's a bit disappointing. It's a bit hard.
1679940	1687040	It's unknown. You don't know what's going to be tomorrow. Is there a big attack also from
1687040	1694260	Hezbollah? Things are going to cool down. Somebody is going to take care of all the people who
1694260	1701620	got injured, who is not home, who is dead. There is so many questions you need to be asked and
1702880	1709320	I don't know. You feel a lot of things right now in Israel, but we all feel very divided.
1710280	1717640	That was Yadin who didn't want us to use her surname talking about her aunt and her partner
1717640	1722460	and their children, including eight-year-old Ella, who they watched being
1723080	1729880	abducted by Hamas fighters on a Facebook Live video on Saturday. We did put her point that
1729880	1734160	the authorities had done very little in her view. To the Israeli military spokesperson we had on
1734160	1740740	the program and she said that they would work to try to recover all of the people who had been taken.
1741940	1747220	That is it for this edition of Newsday. More on that continuing situation in the Middle East
1747220	1750760	on the BBC website at bbcnews.com. Thank you for listening. Thank you.
