00:20.200 --> 00:25.080
Israel is responding to Hamas' surprise attacks at the weekend with a series of airstrikes

00:25.080 --> 00:25.640
in Gaza.

00:25.900 --> 00:29.180
Palestinian health officials say more than 400 people have been killed.

00:29.460 --> 00:34.160
Israel says that more than 700 of its citizens have died in the attacks so far, we get the

00:34.160 --> 00:35.400
latest from both sides.

00:42.940 --> 00:45.420
BBC News with Emily Thomas

00:45.940 --> 00:51.380
The Israeli military has said its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over

00:51.380 --> 00:54.500
500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

00:55.060 --> 01:00.200
Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside

01:00.200 --> 01:04.460
Israel two days after they carried out a devastating mass assault.

01:04.940 --> 01:07.780
More than 700 Israelis have been killed.

01:08.240 --> 01:13.740
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes before

01:13.740 --> 01:14.880
the latest barrage.

01:15.800 --> 01:20.660
Hamas said it had fired missiles targeting Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.

01:21.300 --> 01:26.700
Three U.S. air carriers as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates have suspended services

01:26.700 --> 01:30.900
to Tel Aviv, but some evacuation flights have taken place from the airport.

01:31.480 --> 01:36.600
The UN Security Council has held an emergency meeting in New York to discuss the crisis behind

01:36.600 --> 01:37.300
closed doors.

01:37.780 --> 01:42.680
The UN Middle East envoy called on all countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.

01:44.280 --> 01:49.740
In other news, an independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into allegations

01:49.740 --> 01:55.020
that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan between

01:55.020 --> 01:56.640
2010 and 2013.

01:57.180 --> 02:01.360
The inquiry was set up after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.

02:02.640 --> 02:08.100
The U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is leading a bipartisan delegation to China,

02:08.540 --> 02:10.300
has met the foreign minister Wang Yi.

02:10.760 --> 02:15.260
Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit as Washington seeks to

02:15.260 --> 02:17.180
ease tensions with Beijing.

02:17.800 --> 02:21.540
Mr Wang said he hoped the visit would help the U.S. to view its relationship with

02:21.540 --> 02:23.620
China in a more objective way.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.640
In Ecuador, the state of emergency has been extended by 30 days.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.880
It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential

02:32.880 --> 02:35.100
candidate Fernando Villavicencio.

02:35.580 --> 02:39.540
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were

02:39.540 --> 02:40.380
found dead in prison.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.020
BBC News.

03:12.940 --> 03:17.960
We start this half hour of the programme with the latest developments in Gaza and Israel.

03:18.220 --> 03:22.480
It is now two days since Hamas militants launched a wave of attacks against Israel.

03:22.480 --> 03:28.020
Hamas runs Gaza, where more than two million Palestinians live, and Hamas is also designated

03:28.020 --> 03:31.020
as a terror group by much of the Western world.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.720
The death toll continues to rise.

03:34.040 --> 03:37.480
700 Israelis have been killed and over 2,000 injured.

03:37.960 --> 03:42.240
In retaliation, Israel has launched air strikes on the Gaza Strip, which have killed at least

03:43.540 --> 03:48.940
413 people, and battles are continuing inside Israel between the Israeli Defence

03:48.940 --> 03:51.160
Forces and Hamas fighters.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.480
For the latest, I've been talking to a spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces,

03:55.980 --> 03:57.000
Masha Mickelson.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.760
And I asked if there are still fighters in Israel at the moment.

04:01.360 --> 04:02.480
Yes, there are.

04:03.060 --> 04:07.280
There's fighting still going on in several points in the community surrounding the Gaza

04:07.280 --> 04:14.060
Strip. We're talking about Bari, Raim, Kfar Azad, the Zikim military base.

04:14.060 --> 04:21.440
There's ongoing combat, and it's something that takes hours, multiple hours, to clear

04:21.440 --> 04:23.000
those terrorists out.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.980
And the idea is focusing right now on getting the southern part of Israel back to normal

04:27.980 --> 04:30.220
without terrorists on Israeli soil.

04:30.380 --> 04:32.400
How long do you think it will take to get it back to normal?

04:33.480 --> 04:34.540
It's hard to say.

04:34.700 --> 04:39.460
We hoped we would be in a better situation by the end of yesterday,

04:39.500 --> 04:41.540
but there's still fighting going on.

04:41.540 --> 04:45.860
This is our main objective throughout the day, to save as many lives as possible,

04:46.480 --> 04:50.520
and get the terrorists out of Israel, whatever it takes.

04:51.800 --> 04:57.020
While we're doing that, IDF aircraft are striking in Gaza hundreds of military

04:57.020 --> 04:58.500
Hamas terrorist targets.

05:01.160 --> 05:09.760
We have seen around 880 targets that have been struck, including terror tunnels.

05:11.080 --> 05:16.520
That's, of course, in response to over 3,300 rockets that were fired from the Gaza Strip

05:16.520 --> 05:18.340
in addition to the invasion.

05:18.580 --> 05:21.040
I'm going to come back to the airstrikes in just a moment.

05:21.420 --> 05:25.120
Do you know whether there are still Hamas fighters entering Israel,

05:25.260 --> 05:29.180
or is that boundary between Israel and the Gaza Strip secure?

05:31.380 --> 05:35.360
There are Hamas people trying to infiltrate Israel.

05:35.360 --> 05:40.020
Yes, still as we speak, they're being met with fire from IDF UAVs that are

05:40.020 --> 05:41.500
surveilling the area of the border.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.340
When they entered two days ago in the morning,

05:45.080 --> 05:48.280
they blew up significant parts of the fence.

05:48.740 --> 05:53.540
So there are still breached points of the fence that we are securing through the year.

05:53.960 --> 05:59.440
Do you know how many people have been abducted and taken from Israel to Gaza?

06:00.400 --> 06:03.160
We don't have the exact numbers, but it's in the dozens.

06:03.160 --> 06:07.620
Right. We spoke to one family an hour ago on this program.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.380
They think that five members of their family, including an eight-year-old girl, have been taken.

06:14.220 --> 06:17.340
And they contacted us because they were worried that the authorities were not doing

06:17.340 --> 06:20.580
all they could to try to secure their return.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.640
If you don't know exactly how many people have been taken,

06:24.840 --> 06:28.680
do you have any idea where these people are and what are you intending to do

06:28.680 --> 06:30.120
to try to secure their release?

06:31.080 --> 06:38.840
We've seen documentation of hostages being held in Gaza in apartments and basements.

06:39.300 --> 06:42.980
They're spread through multiple locations as far as we know.

06:43.840 --> 06:50.580
The top officers in the military are currently presenting the political echelon

06:50.580 --> 06:55.480
in the security cabinet for the past two days with plausible military options to go forward.

06:55.980 --> 07:00.700
And of course, the hostages and their possible locations are being taken into account

07:01.360 --> 07:03.840
as we decide what our next step is.

07:04.080 --> 07:08.920
Israel is a state that holds human life sacred and we will do everything in our power

07:09.680 --> 07:12.820
to ensure that they're coming back home safe.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.520
But this is who Hamas is.

07:14.700 --> 07:18.760
For years, they have been saying that this is their goal to eliminate the Jewish state,

07:18.900 --> 07:21.940
to kill as many Jewish people as possible, to kidnap Jewish people.

07:22.800 --> 07:26.280
And 48 hours ago, they showed their true face to the world.

07:27.060 --> 07:28.720
Let's talk about the airstrikes.

07:29.120 --> 07:35.560
You said that Hamas targets and tunnels that allow Hamas fighters to get from Gaza into Israel

07:35.560 --> 07:41.980
have been hit by airstrikes, but also residential tower blocks have and mosques as well.

07:42.340 --> 07:47.340
And we hear that more than 400 people have been killed, including children.

07:47.780 --> 07:53.860
So Palestinian civilians are being killed and injured in these airstrikes, aren't they?

07:55.320 --> 08:02.280
We're at war. The IDF targets, military targets that are used by Hamas.

08:02.520 --> 08:10.320
Now, if Hamas treats their civilians for years as human shields, hiding ammunition

08:10.320 --> 08:14.640
storages, hiding rocket launchers beneath schools, beneath mosques,

08:14.640 --> 08:20.460
beneath UN facilities and kindergartens, we've seen how they treat Israeli citizens that they have

08:20.460 --> 08:25.180
kidnapped. The IDF strikes targets that we have intelligence on that are being used by

08:25.180 --> 08:30.360
Hamas for terrorism. And the way that Hamas acts is entrenching themselves cynically

08:30.960 --> 08:36.300
within civilian population to make these actions more complicated for the IDF.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.280
Of course, we are aware of that, but we are at war.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.100
Masha Mickelson, the spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces, and I mentioned a family

08:44.700 --> 08:51.460
in that interview, too, that IDF spokesperson who are waiting for news on five relatives who

08:51.460 --> 08:56.900
have been abducted by Hamas fighters. We're going to play the interview with one of

08:56.900 --> 08:58.420
those family members later on in the program.

08:58.980 --> 09:03.500
Well, the number of Palestinians killed in the violence has also continued to rise.

09:03.500 --> 09:09.620
Health officials in Gaza said there is more than 400 deaths so far, and over 2,000 people

09:09.620 --> 09:15.180
have been injured, as Israel launches more air strikes on the territory. The Israeli air force

09:15.180 --> 09:19.960
says that it struck over 500 terrorist targets in Gaza overnight.

09:20.300 --> 09:23.900
Well, for more, we are now joined by Professor Lina Katibi, who is the director

09:23.900 --> 09:29.820
of the Middle East Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies University here

09:29.820 --> 09:33.360
in London. Good morning to you and welcome to Newsday.

09:33.900 --> 09:39.700
In your opinion, why do you think Hamas militants launched the operation in the first place?

09:41.960 --> 09:48.860
The main reason is, of course, to try to put an end to the Israeli occupation that has been

09:48.860 --> 09:55.760
going on for many, many, many years. The situation in Gaza in particular is really

09:55.760 --> 10:02.900
very tough. It's been under siege for almost two decades, and Hamas wants to present itself

10:02.900 --> 10:07.640
to the Palestinians as the entity that can make a difference in that regard.

10:08.120 --> 10:13.800
So we have to remember here that the main goal for Hamas is political behind this military

10:13.800 --> 10:21.180
operation. It's not to just call short-term destabilization. It's actually to say this is

10:21.180 --> 10:32.500
a game-changing attack that puts Hamas as the central Palestinian entity for the world to kind of

10:32.500 --> 10:38.580
engage with. But then one would wonder with this attack and seeing so many Palestinians dead and

10:38.580 --> 10:45.580
obviously the ongoing fighting is still on. How much support does that leave Hamas

10:45.580 --> 10:47.880
where we're in Gaza and among Palestinians?

10:48.600 --> 10:56.100
Actually Hamas now enjoys wide support for this attack. People are very aware of the high price

10:56.100 --> 11:02.820
that will be paid because of course Israel's retaliation is not going to be mild. And yet

11:02.820 --> 11:10.360
they are so desperate that they feel they have nothing to lose. So that's why you're seeing

11:10.360 --> 11:17.560
not just in Gaza but even wider in the Arab world a lot of support expressed for Hamas.

11:18.520 --> 11:26.500
I think the Israel-Palestine conflict had been ignored for so long internationally that people

11:26.500 --> 11:31.200
feel desperate measures are needed. And you said that there's even more wide

11:31.200 --> 11:37.020
support for Hamas in the region as such. But looking at all that, we're not only

11:37.020 --> 11:42.280
talking about infrastructures. There are lives and people who are being killed and injured and some

11:42.280 --> 11:49.460
will be probably hostages. I wonder then in your opinion where does this go? How does this get

11:49.460 --> 11:57.320
solved if anyone at all? The only way to resolve the situation is to resolve the Israel-Palestine

11:57.320 --> 12:03.260
conflict. I mean without the conflict having been protracted for many many years,

12:03.260 --> 12:09.620
Hamas would not have existed in the first place. I mean we have to remember in the 70s and 80s,

12:09.620 --> 12:17.540
early 80s there was no Hamas. It was Fatah, the PLO and some other groups. But Hamas is a

12:17.540 --> 12:24.080
relative newcomer in the history of the conflict and a product of the kind of stagnation

12:24.080 --> 12:29.520
of this conflict politically. So the only way to resolve this is to go back to politics

12:29.520 --> 12:38.080
and find a solution that is acceptable to Palestinians. I think you know these kinds of

12:38.080 --> 12:45.120
groups like Hamas basically find an opening in protracted conflict and try to assert themselves

12:45.920 --> 12:52.040
as a result. So we need the US back on track, we need the UK, we need the international community

12:52.040 --> 12:57.720
at large to take this conflict seriously. We've already seen regional actors like Saudi Arabia

12:57.720 --> 13:04.160
saying they are serious about wanting to find a solution to this conflict as well. So I think

13:04.680 --> 13:11.160
this is the only way out. It's not about a military victory for anybody. It has to be

13:11.160 --> 13:16.040
a political solution that restores peace. And briefly if you may, where does this leave

13:16.040 --> 13:20.960
then the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in those conversations about a solution?

13:22.260 --> 13:29.580
One of the things that is being achieved also by Hamas in this attack is to show

13:29.580 --> 13:36.060
the weakness of the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas. I think he's going to face

13:36.060 --> 13:43.920
increasing criticism from Palestinians about the failures of his leadership. And it is likely that

13:44.740 --> 13:51.080
in the aftermath of this attack, the Palestinian Authority will seek to find another leader

13:51.590 --> 13:57.420
to replace Abbas, although it's not clear who that leader could be because there has not been a clear

13:57.420 --> 14:02.700
succession plan. But definitely something needs to change in that regard as well.

14:02.980 --> 14:06.940
Professor Lina Khatib, thank you for coming on to the program. She is the director of the

14:06.940 --> 14:12.540
Middle East Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies University here in London.

14:12.540 --> 14:17.880
Well, aid and refugee groups are already warning that civilians on both sides have paid and will

14:17.880 --> 14:24.580
continue to pay the heaviest price. More than 123,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza so far,

14:25.000 --> 14:29.960
with close to 74,000 seeking shelter in schools, according to the United Nations.

14:30.120 --> 14:35.440
Well, on the line now from Jerusalem is Shayna Lowe of the Norwegian Refugee Council.

14:35.780 --> 14:39.980
Welcome to Newsday, Shayna. What are your teams on the ground telling you?

14:39.980 --> 14:49.640
Good morning. Yes, I just spoke to my colleague in Gaza about an hour ago. Last night was a

14:49.640 --> 14:54.960
terrifying night full of bombardments. My colleague Yusef has two young children,

14:55.460 --> 15:00.200
and they are doing all that they can to protect their children, distract them from what's going

15:00.200 --> 15:07.540
on outside their windows. The night for them is, of course, the scariest time of day because

15:07.540 --> 15:12.460
they just do not know what will happen, and it's when Israeli airstrikes really ramp up.

15:13.000 --> 15:20.060
In terms of our ability to operate on the ground in Gaza, we can't right now. Our staff has been

15:20.060 --> 15:25.200
told to shelter in place and take care of themselves and their families. And so we're

15:25.200 --> 15:29.640
desperately waiting for a cessation of the hostilities in order for our staff to be

15:29.640 --> 15:34.840
able to go out and assess the damage and provide needs and provide assistance

15:35.560 --> 15:42.180
to those who are in need. So even as the UN says more than 120,000 Palestinians currently don't

15:42.180 --> 15:48.960
have a home, you're unable to help them? Exactly. I mean, so long as there's

15:50.440 --> 15:55.820
ongoing hostilities, we cannot, in good conscience, we have a duty of care to our staff,

15:57.580 --> 16:03.040
and we cannot send them out to go and provide assistance until we know that they can reach

16:03.040 --> 16:07.560
communities safely. Right. I see. What are you hearing from your team in Israel?

16:08.700 --> 16:16.360
Well, we actually don't operate in Israel. We operate only in occupied Palestinian territory,

16:16.360 --> 16:22.000
so that includes the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and then also in the Gaza Strip.

16:22.240 --> 16:29.880
Right. Now, we know that the food situation was already stretched in Gaza before

16:30.880 --> 16:37.620
Saturday's events. What is your message to the international community about the kinds of help

16:38.200 --> 16:42.160
that is needed, and what is the likelihood that that help will be able to get through?

16:42.960 --> 16:47.640
Yeah. I mean, we need to have demands from the international community to call for,

16:47.820 --> 16:52.540
if not a cessation of the hostilities, at least a pause in which humanitarian actors

16:52.540 --> 17:00.300
can access Gaza and provide assistance. I understand that yesterday the crossing with

17:00.300 --> 17:06.500
Egypt was open and that some truckloads of food came in, but the reality in Gaza is that food

17:06.500 --> 17:13.180
supplies are always very short. There's not a lot of extra food that is stockpiled there,

17:13.440 --> 17:17.800
and so we, of course, are calling for a cessation of the hostilities so that

17:17.800 --> 17:23.760
the international community, humanitarian organizations can bring in additional supplies

17:24.360 --> 17:29.020
for Palestinians in need. We heard from a spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces

17:29.020 --> 17:33.600
earlier on the program who was clear that if there is a location where they believe there is a

17:33.600 --> 17:39.760
Hamas fighter or leader, they will target that location. So what is your message to civilians

17:39.760 --> 17:44.240
in Gaza about whether they're at home or if they're displaced, but what they should do,

17:44.240 --> 17:49.540
where they should go? I mean, the reality is that there is no safe place in Gaza.

17:50.000 --> 17:56.040
For 16 years, Gaza has been besieged. Palestinians living there have very little ability to get

17:56.040 --> 18:03.220
out or move. It's one of the most densely populated places on earth. 2.2 million people

18:03.220 --> 18:10.200
are living there. And so when we hear remarks from Benjamin Netanyahu calling for Palestinians

18:10.200 --> 18:16.700
in Gaza to leave, our question is, where should they go? Because Israel controls

18:17.760 --> 18:24.740
people's exit from the Gaza Strip into Israel. Yes, exactly. And the Egyptian border,

18:24.920 --> 18:31.000
my understanding is that it was open yesterday. For people to leave or not, do you know?

18:31.440 --> 18:38.220
Well, people can leave, but it's cost prohibitive. So the Egyptian authorities

18:38.940 --> 18:45.620
control the cost of exiting into Egypt. And my understanding is that they have increased that

18:45.620 --> 18:52.260
cost considerably. And there are limitations in terms of the capacity that they have at this time

18:52.260 --> 18:56.840
to be letting people flee for safety. All right. Thanks very much. That's

18:56.840 --> 19:01.380
Shayna Lowe there from the Norwegian Refugee Council, who was on the line from Jerusalem.

19:01.380 --> 19:06.200
And joining us back in the studio is Isaac Fennin with All This Fool.

19:08.540 --> 19:14.260
Arsenal got a massive 1-0 win over Manchester City in the Premier League. Gabriela Martinelli

19:14.260 --> 19:19.920
scoring the win. It was Ghana's first win in City in the League since 2015. Here's their manager,

19:20.380 --> 19:26.720
Miquel Arteta. It's been a long time since the club hasn't beat Man City. And we discussed

19:26.720 --> 19:31.080
that a lot. And we felt like today could be the day, but we needed a big performance,

19:31.440 --> 19:36.360
huge individual performances. And we had that. And with a bit of luck, we managed to win the game.

19:36.800 --> 19:41.320
For City, it's two defeats in the row in the Premier League for the first time in five years.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.240
But manager Pep Guardiola says it's not the time to panic.

19:44.680 --> 19:48.660
We're in October. People say, OK, this year is not going to happen. We're not going to

19:48.660 --> 19:53.040
win the Premier League four times in a row. Listen, no team in all history have won

19:53.040 --> 19:58.520
four times in a row. But we are in October. And from experience as a manager, this is a long,

19:58.680 --> 20:03.200
long road. European football's governing body UEFA has postponed. All matches scheduled

20:03.200 --> 20:07.260
in Israel during the next fortnight amid increased tension in the region.

20:07.820 --> 20:13.980
Israel were due to play Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv. But that game has

20:13.980 --> 20:18.520
been rescheduled. And UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days to see

20:18.520 --> 20:24.400
whether Israel's European championship qualifier in Kosovo can take place in October.

20:25.240 --> 20:31.380
Simone Biles secured another two gold medals at the World Gymnastics Championships. Her 22nd

20:31.380 --> 20:36.920
and 23rd, she won the beam and four titles to add to the team. And all around success

20:36.920 --> 20:43.240
earlier on in the competition, she's got four gold medals on her return to the sport. She

20:43.240 --> 20:47.820
is the most decorated gymnast in the sports history. And she's done all this,

20:48.060 --> 20:52.800
having taken some time off after the Tokyo Olympics to focus on her mental health.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.640
It hasn't been easy. I've been focusing a lot on my gymnastics and my mental,

20:56.960 --> 21:01.040
going to therapy, making sure that's in my regular scheduled routine as of anything else.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.320
But I'm really proud of the work that I put in because at the beginning of the year, I

21:04.320 --> 21:08.320
wasn't sure I was going to be competing. And I actually wasn't supposed to be competing.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.600
So to end up here now at Worlds at the end of the year, it's just like,

21:11.740 --> 21:13.280
I just keep amazing myself.

21:13.700 --> 21:19.740
There was a huge result in the Rugby World Cup as Portugal beat Fiji 24-23

21:19.740 --> 21:25.740
to claim their first ever win at their first ever World Cup. Here's their player, Nicholas Martin.

21:26.340 --> 21:33.420
Something incredible. I work a lot for that. I have nowhere to say that it's historic.

21:33.420 --> 21:37.600
I'm so happy. I think it's the best moment of my life.

21:37.800 --> 21:46.960
We are a team of friends from France, from Portugal, but we live together. It's something incredible.

21:47.500 --> 21:51.160
Now despite their second loss of the group phase, Fiji are still

21:51.160 --> 21:56.320
through to the quarter-finals. They will play England next weekend in Marseille.

21:56.680 --> 22:01.540
And finally, Kenyon, Kelvin, Kiptum shattered the men's marathon world record

22:01.540 --> 22:05.680
in Chicago as he beat Kampatria-Ellid, Kipchoge's previous mark

22:05.680 --> 22:12.140
by more than 30 seconds. The 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours and 35 seconds.

22:15.940 --> 22:21.280
Isaac Fennin, thank you so much for that news about the sporting world. Now this is news there

22:21.280 --> 22:26.940
with Vic and Rob in other news this morning. An independent inquiry in the UK will begin

22:26.940 --> 22:33.180
hearings today into allegations that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians

22:33.180 --> 22:40.360
in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2013. The inquiry was set up after legal action was brought by two

22:40.360 --> 22:46.080
Afghan families. The US state majority leader, Chuck Schumer, who is leading a bipartisan

22:46.080 --> 22:51.900
delegation to China, has met with the foreign minister Wang Yi. Mr. Schumer is the latest high

22:51.900 --> 22:58.040
level American official to visit as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing. Mr. Wang said

22:58.040 --> 23:04.020
he hoped that the visit would help the US to view its relationship with China in a more objective

23:04.020 --> 23:10.940
way. And in Ecuador, the state of emergency has been extended by 30 days. It's been in place

23:10.940 --> 23:16.320
since the assassination in August of anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Vila Citencio.

23:16.320 --> 23:22.200
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing who are found dead in

23:22.200 --> 23:28.280
prison. Now we're going to return to our main story now. It is more than 48 hours after Saturday's

23:28.280 --> 23:34.540
unprecedented assault by fighters belonging to Hamas, which is designated as a terror organization by

23:34.540 --> 23:41.280
Wani Western nations on Israel. And Hamas claims to have abducted more than 100 Israelis

23:41.280 --> 23:47.220
with many taken over the boundary from Israel into Gaza. Some of them are believed to be Israeli

23:47.220 --> 23:52.720
soldiers and many are civilians. Well, we've been contacted by a family anxious to know about the

23:52.720 --> 23:58.020
fate of their five relatives who've been taken away from the Kibbutz of Nahos, which is a few

23:58.020 --> 24:04.300
kilometers from Gaza. And I spoke on Sunday night to Yadin, who told me more about her missing

24:04.300 --> 24:10.120
relatives. And she says she watched a Facebook live video in which she could see them being

24:10.120 --> 24:14.660
taken, she thought, across the boundary into Gaza by these abductors.

24:40.220 --> 24:47.360
If people didn't open the door and listen to them, they just shut the door and shut the people

24:47.360 --> 24:53.620
whichever they want and took the rest in captivity. We don't know if they took them

24:53.620 --> 24:58.800
across the border or just leave them there. We have no idea. And you could see all of this on

24:58.800 --> 25:07.500
the video on Facebook. Yeah, it's 30 minutes live. Other than that, we just lost contact. So

25:07.500 --> 25:13.940
there is no service or anything you can reach them. They are two little kids, two little daughters

25:13.940 --> 25:20.020
of the partner who we don't know where they are. If they are together, if somebody is taking care

25:20.020 --> 25:27.400
of them, there is another child who is 17 years old. It's a frightening situation. You said that

25:27.400 --> 25:32.240
your aunt's partner appeared to have been shot in the leg. Was it clear from the video

25:32.240 --> 25:37.460
whether he'd been given any medical care and how did the others in the video look?

25:38.160 --> 25:48.120
One of the many videos that we saw is we saw Noam, the aunt's partner taking people of the

25:48.120 --> 25:54.180
Hamas, is helping him walk through the border. Like for a two second shot, you could see it.

25:54.980 --> 26:01.120
Other than that, we don't know anything. We just saw him walking very poorly.

26:01.780 --> 26:07.360
How does that make you feel knowing that they've been taken or suspecting they've been taken to Gaza?

26:08.540 --> 26:15.400
Terrible. All I can think is why the hell should I know they are being kept in Gaza via

26:16.240 --> 26:22.880
channel Instagram. Presumably you've called your aunt's phone. Does it ring? Does anybody answer?

26:24.660 --> 26:34.520
Actually, at the beginning, when some people try to text her, the Hamas answered the phone and wrote

26:34.520 --> 26:42.000
in English. But other than that, when we try to call now, there is no line. You don't reach

26:42.000 --> 26:46.980
to anything. It's ringing, but nobody answered. Have you spoken to the police? Have you spoken

26:46.980 --> 26:53.880
to people in the army? We try. Even during the library, we call the authorities and they all say

26:53.880 --> 27:00.460
they are aware of the problem and they really don't have something to do right now. It is a chaos.

27:00.800 --> 27:06.600
It is really a chaos. It was a chaos. It's still a chaos. People don't know how to manage.

27:07.280 --> 27:11.880
It was really a surprise attack. People don't know how to manage the situation.

27:12.480 --> 27:16.880
What do you and the rest of the family want the authorities to do when it comes to your

27:16.880 --> 27:23.640
aunt's partner and his children? We want to bring them home safe, no matter what the price is.

27:24.080 --> 27:32.040
I think we all, the toll they took from us, we have 700 people killed,

27:32.460 --> 27:43.560
thousands of people injured, not several injured, wounded very hard. It's not supposed to be in

27:43.560 --> 27:47.640
civilians' people. Civilians shouldn't be paying this price.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.700
Your family is clearly going through a very worrying, harrowing time at the moment.

27:53.080 --> 27:59.460
What is it like being an Israeli right now? It's a bit disappointing. It's a bit hard.

27:59.940 --> 28:07.040
It's unknown. You don't know what's going to be tomorrow. Is there a big attack also from

28:07.040 --> 28:14.260
Hezbollah? Things are going to cool down. Somebody is going to take care of all the people who

28:14.260 --> 28:21.620
got injured, who is not home, who is dead. There is so many questions you need to be asked and

28:22.880 --> 28:29.320
I don't know. You feel a lot of things right now in Israel, but we all feel very divided.

28:30.280 --> 28:37.640
That was Yadin who didn't want us to use her surname talking about her aunt and her partner

28:37.640 --> 28:42.460
and their children, including eight-year-old Ella, who they watched being

28:43.080 --> 28:49.880
abducted by Hamas fighters on a Facebook Live video on Saturday. We did put her point that

28:49.880 --> 28:54.160
the authorities had done very little in her view. To the Israeli military spokesperson we had on

28:54.160 --> 29:00.740
the program and she said that they would work to try to recover all of the people who had been taken.

29:01.940 --> 29:07.220
That is it for this edition of Newsday. More on that continuing situation in the Middle East

29:07.220 --> 29:10.760
