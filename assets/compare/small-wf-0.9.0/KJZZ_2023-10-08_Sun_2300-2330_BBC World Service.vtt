00:20.660 --> 00:26.240
This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side

00:26.240 --> 00:29.500
with more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.300
We hear from a woman in Gaza.

00:31.840 --> 00:37.420
The last couple of days were harrowing and the air strikes were very frequent and huge.

00:38.020 --> 00:44.940
Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with each and every missile very impactful and damaging.

00:45.600 --> 00:51.120
In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival,

00:51.280 --> 00:53.280
the first site attacked by Hamas.

00:53.540 --> 00:57.360
We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones

00:57.360 --> 01:00.320
that has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.760
And another news will go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000 people.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.880
Rescue efforts are continuing, but first we're getting a bulletin of world news.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.990
This is Danielle Yauvetska with the BBC News. Hello.

01:17.750 --> 01:21.670
The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery

01:21.670 --> 01:25.590
have struck over 500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

01:25.590 --> 01:32.030
Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel

01:32.030 --> 01:35.650
two days after they carried out their devastating mass assault.

01:36.290 --> 01:38.330
More than 700 Israelis have been killed.

01:38.850 --> 01:40.130
John Donison is in Jerusalem.

01:40.830 --> 01:46.450
The Israeli military says it has continued to target Hamas infrastructure with air strikes overnight.

01:47.030 --> 01:51.690
The United Nations says more than 120,000 gardens have now been displaced

01:51.690 --> 01:54.490
with many seeking shelter in UN schools.

01:54.490 --> 01:57.250
But most believe this is just the beginning.

01:57.730 --> 02:04.070
Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000 army reservists.

02:04.530 --> 02:07.670
Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion.

02:08.210 --> 02:13.130
With Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

02:13.690 --> 02:18.310
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far

02:18.310 --> 02:21.910
by Israeli air strikes. Over 2,000 people have been injured.

02:21.910 --> 02:26.490
They said power cuts were widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical workers.

02:26.910 --> 02:30.070
Hamas said it had fired a new barrage of missiles into Israel.

02:30.630 --> 02:36.610
Three US air carriers as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates have suspended flights to Tel Aviv.

02:37.550 --> 02:41.730
The United States says it is sending immediate extra munitions to Israel.

02:42.010 --> 02:47.550
The Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels including an aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean.

02:48.230 --> 02:50.430
More from Barbara Plattasha in Washington.

02:50.430 --> 02:55.930
The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas

02:55.930 --> 02:57.830
could draw in other parts of the region.

02:58.250 --> 03:03.250
They're sending an aircraft carrier with a deck of warplanes accompanied by cruisers and destroyers.

03:03.470 --> 03:05.990
Also extra military assistance such as munitions.

03:06.550 --> 03:11.230
In particular they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the fight.

03:11.510 --> 03:14.810
It's backed by Iran which also funds and arms Hamas.

03:15.350 --> 03:19.070
There are reports that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack.

03:19.070 --> 03:23.970
Although the Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.

03:24.830 --> 03:30.070
The UN Security Council has held an emergency closed door session to discuss the crisis.

03:30.790 --> 03:35.870
The UN Middle East envoy called on countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.

03:36.270 --> 03:38.130
More from Netta Taufiq in New York.

03:38.610 --> 03:41.730
Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement.

03:42.210 --> 03:44.010
Not all but many condemned Hamas.

03:44.010 --> 03:52.430
The UAE's ambassador to the UN, Lana Nusebe, told reporters there was real concern that tensions in the region could become inflamed.

03:52.850 --> 04:00.690
Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.

04:01.150 --> 04:08.650
The Palestinian UN ambassador, Riyad Mansour, told reporters he'd requested an emergency meeting of Arab League states in Cairo.

04:09.430 --> 04:11.150
BBC World News.

04:12.330 --> 04:23.770
An independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into allegations that British Special Forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians including children in Afghanistan.

04:24.730 --> 04:29.590
The inquiry was set up by the British government after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.

04:30.950 --> 04:38.010
The US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to China, has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

04:38.010 --> 04:44.130
Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.

04:45.550 --> 04:55.070
Regional elections in two of Germany's largest and wealthiest states, Bavaria and Hesse, have dealt a blow to the parties that form the centre-left federal government.

04:55.570 --> 05:00.790
Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberal Free Democrats.

05:01.390 --> 05:04.030
The Christian Democrats again emerge as the largest party.

05:04.890 --> 05:09.870
The president of Ecuador has extended the state of emergency by 30 days.

05:10.210 --> 05:16.750
It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio.

05:17.410 --> 05:22.110
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were found dead in prison.

05:23.470 --> 05:30.090
A horde of coins believed to have belonged to a Highland clan chief who was murdered more than 300 years ago has been found in Scotland.

05:30.710 --> 05:32.090
Alexandra McKenzie reports.

05:32.830 --> 05:39.130
The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the first major excavation in Glencoe.

05:39.350 --> 05:44.550
The dig focused on scattered rocks believed to have been the McDonald clan chief's summer house.

05:44.810 --> 05:53.170
More than 300 years after he died in the Glencoe massacre, an archaeology student taking part in her first-ever dig found the horde.

05:53.170 --> 05:59.110
The University of Glasgow said the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins.

05:59.490 --> 06:08.430
A number of other artefacts were also discovered at the site, including a musket and fouling shot, pottery from across Europe and a powder major.

06:09.170 --> 06:10.290
BBC News

06:34.230 --> 06:42.130
We are starting with the latest development in Israel in Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.

06:42.550 --> 06:49.370
The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall, with more than 2,000 injured.

06:49.370 --> 06:59.570
The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.

07:00.010 --> 07:07.670
The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.

07:07.670 --> 07:19.810
In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip, with more than 2,000 wounded, according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.

07:20.810 --> 07:30.730
Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale destruction, shops are closed, the streets are empty, the city is said to be like a ghost town.

07:30.730 --> 07:42.990
According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have now been displaced in Gaza because of the airstrikes, and many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.

07:43.150 --> 07:46.370
In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.

07:46.370 --> 08:06.690
The last couple of days were harrowing, and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge, because it's a very highly dense, populated area with very limited geographical area, like with over 2 million people living in 360 kilometers

08:06.690 --> 08:26.350
square, which make each and every missile dropped very impactful and damaging. The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing, decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian land

08:26.350 --> 08:34.350
and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.

08:34.350 --> 09:00.270
Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians, refusing its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison

09:00.270 --> 09:12.610
with restrictions on right to movement, right to health, and many other associated basic rights. Yet we were told as civilians to leave, I mean, leave and go where.

09:13.830 --> 09:22.430
No crossings are open, neither the sea. That is also a restriction to some point. If you trespass, you can be shot.

09:22.430 --> 09:44.410
For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed, including women, children, elderly and persons with disabilities. I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school shelters that not even fully prepare or accommodate these numbers and provide for their needs.

09:44.410 --> 10:12.710
I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws and conflicts and its principles. These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and civilians, avoid disproportionate use of force and have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies for the population.

10:12.710 --> 10:37.850
And now there is limited electricity and crossings are fully closed to let in any supplies. But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles. And the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.

10:37.850 --> 10:52.370
A resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like. And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com for a slash news. There is a live page of being updated as we get more news.

10:52.370 --> 11:04.450
Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism, a former member of the Knessetli-Israeli parliament, Mikhail Kotlovich. Thanks so much for joining us.

11:05.430 --> 11:06.870
Thank you so much for having me.

11:06.870 --> 11:09.070
How are Israelis feeling today?

11:10.330 --> 11:39.050
You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is, it actually encourages me to ask you the question, because, you know, when I hear the framing of what is happening in Israel, where a genocidal terror organization holding 2 million civilians in Gaza, alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were in our home.

11:39.050 --> 11:54.670
In our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel, 5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza. Each rocket, a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.

11:54.670 --> 12:19.570
When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260, at least, young party goers on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the anti-Semitic terror organization, Hamas, actually designated as a terror organization funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran,

12:19.570 --> 12:39.670
holding its own civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza, in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West, that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.

12:39.670 --> 12:59.590
So I would turn the question to you, if this were happening anywhere else in the world, not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians, but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians, where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians

12:59.590 --> 13:25.610
in holding families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip of entire families being butchered in their homes and to hear the way that the framing, that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.

13:25.610 --> 13:41.690
Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives on this as we can. I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got a sense from you of the anger there is and the sadness too.

13:41.830 --> 13:46.170
No, there is no anger. We are fighting for our lives. There is no anger. Let it be clear.

13:46.170 --> 13:54.410
You said that this is like Israel's 9-11. Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?

13:55.230 --> 14:06.590
It's not just because of this shock. It's because of the same modus operandi. This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us at the moment.

14:06.590 --> 14:19.970
Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that must defend its citizens from terror. You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand what Israelis are feeling.

14:19.970 --> 14:38.450
There is no both sides when a terror organization ravages civilian areas, enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians, breaking barriers, that there is a fence, there has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.

14:39.570 --> 14:41.770
There has been a blockade though, hasn't there of Gaza?

15:17.010 --> 15:25.470
How do you think the Israeli military should respond then? We've seen, I told more than 500 airstrikes over the weekend.

15:27.770 --> 15:29.990
My job is to ask questions, not answer them.

15:55.870 --> 16:13.970
To my question, how do you think the military should respond? There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza, although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment. Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government to go?

16:13.970 --> 16:26.010
There are dozens of Israeli hostages and many of them are civilians that were abducted, many of them raped, many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated.

16:26.010 --> 16:36.730
And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must the citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak.

16:37.350 --> 16:49.470
And every country that cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught, massacre of its civilians.

16:49.470 --> 17:06.450
And those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization, and I want to make it very clear alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers and two civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.

17:06.450 --> 17:23.470
And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries must call for the immediate and unconditional return because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.

17:23.970 --> 17:32.310
And what the IDF will have to do and the state of Israel will have to do in its existential war is not just about the state of Israel. I want to make it very clear to your listeners.

17:32.310 --> 17:35.550
Mikaela, Katla, Vunch, we've got to leave it there. Thanks for joining us.

17:36.390 --> 17:48.150
Well, staying with this story and looking at the business side of things, one industry that's already filling the impact of this conflict is the aviation industry with dozens of flights already cancelled.

17:48.650 --> 17:54.430
Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore, Keti Silva. Keti, what are we seeing?

17:55.590 --> 18:04.870
Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines cancelling flights. The likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair all cancelled journeys.

18:05.350 --> 18:13.950
British Airways for its part told the BBC that it's only cancelled one flight on Sunday and that it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days.

18:14.070 --> 18:21.450
And that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport or if perhaps they want to land at different times of the day that may be deemed safer.

18:21.450 --> 18:29.430
Many of these airlines are also offering passengers to cancel their flights or to move the dates with no sort of change fees.

18:30.210 --> 18:36.150
Flights to Israel's second international airport, Iliad, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea, they've been unaffected.

18:36.390 --> 18:47.370
But we've also heard that Israelis flag carrier LL, it's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now, but again allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.

18:47.370 --> 18:53.550
But get to this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying or desperately trying to leave.

18:54.670 --> 19:05.630
Oh, to leave as well as to get home. So that's one of the major issues is that many have found themselves stranded and with fears about whether or not the airspace will be closed.

19:05.950 --> 19:12.570
So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there amongst them stranded in Cyprus, Atlanta International Airport late last night.

19:13.330 --> 19:17.510
Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights home.

19:18.250 --> 19:21.850
As I say, rumors about whether or not the country may close its airspace.

19:22.370 --> 19:28.010
It was hard to get tickets, we understand. Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights.

19:28.830 --> 19:31.090
And getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.

19:31.530 --> 19:40.670
In terms of leaving the country, I've heard, for example, as well from Athens, the foreign ministry, saying that's working to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.

19:40.670 --> 19:44.630
Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece.

19:44.850 --> 19:49.650
But there is indeed much concern about many of the foreign workers in Israel.

19:49.830 --> 19:53.310
I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel.

19:53.550 --> 19:58.130
And so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home if indeed they want to leave Israel.

19:58.570 --> 20:04.190
All right, Katie Silver always a pleasure to have you on the program, our business correspondent there in Singapore.

20:04.190 --> 20:10.470
And we are remaining with this story and we are now going to speak to our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.

20:11.110 --> 20:16.470
Good morning to you, Jeremy. Now, you have called this a major Middle East crisis.

20:16.790 --> 20:18.750
Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?

20:19.830 --> 20:29.230
Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas has been able to break out of Gaza,

20:29.230 --> 20:35.190
which is surrounded by, if you like, a ring of steel, of fences, wire fences and concrete,

20:35.850 --> 20:42.590
break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis, including many, many civilians.

20:43.490 --> 20:47.410
That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before.

20:48.030 --> 20:54.590
And it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma and plenty of people here

20:55.230 --> 20:58.550
compare it to the 9-11 attacks in the United States.

20:59.230 --> 21:04.310
There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that if you adjust the death toll for population,

21:05.430 --> 21:09.530
it's equivalent of the Americans losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.

21:09.810 --> 21:18.990
So it's a big, big event and the Israeli response, which is going to be, is already very heavy military action,

21:19.130 --> 21:22.530
but I think there'll be a land invasion too of Gaza.

21:23.330 --> 21:28.370
Now that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region.

21:29.230 --> 21:32.090
And to really unexplored territory right now.

21:32.870 --> 21:36.670
And Jeremy, you have been in the region, you have been in the area.

21:36.910 --> 21:43.570
Just for our listeners' benefit, can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like and how that area is to Israel?

21:45.970 --> 21:54.870
Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast, which is surrounded mostly by Israel,

21:54.870 --> 22:00.950
but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.

22:03.250 --> 22:08.850
The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.

22:09.470 --> 22:16.790
Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948,

22:17.170 --> 22:20.710
a time that the Palestinians called the Nakba, the catastrophe.

22:21.470 --> 22:25.190
And it's an area where people are mostly very poor.

22:25.550 --> 22:28.770
They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.

22:29.230 --> 22:31.670
They're mostly not allowed to leave the area.

22:32.270 --> 22:35.630
There are plenty of adults there who've never left.

22:36.770 --> 22:44.070
And so it is a situation which is, life there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic.

22:44.070 --> 22:49.850
And since 2007, it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas,

22:50.010 --> 22:53.590
which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement.

22:54.030 --> 23:00.730
And you wrote a nice read on our website where you said that Hamas blindsided Israel

23:00.730 --> 23:04.330
with what you call the most serious attack in a generation.

23:04.730 --> 23:09.850
And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken, including civilians as well as soldiers.

23:09.850 --> 23:15.750
What sort of challenge does this pose for the government of Mr Netanyahu and the army going forward?

23:16.730 --> 23:25.730
It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government has, I think, faced probably for 50 years since the 1973 Middle East War.

23:28.250 --> 23:35.890
His political enemies are already blaming him, saying that he took his afterball for a variety of reasons.

23:36.610 --> 23:40.930
It's clear that there's been, from the Israeli perspective, a huge intelligence failure.

23:41.630 --> 23:44.370
And they're struggling militarily to assert themselves.

23:44.670 --> 23:50.350
They will succeed in doing that. I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.

23:51.250 --> 23:59.250
I think the big question, which was, and this is probably an equal challenge for the Israelis,

23:59.250 --> 24:01.850
is what happens after that?

24:02.410 --> 24:07.410
What happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?

24:07.730 --> 24:13.250
Because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza and finally pulled out in 2005

24:15.310 --> 24:18.170
do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation.

24:18.350 --> 24:24.270
But if they sent in their troops, there's going to have to be some kind of governance of a territory

24:24.270 --> 24:30.630
which is maybe small, but as I said, contains getting on for two and a half million people.

24:32.070 --> 24:36.110
Jeremy Bowen there. Thank you for coming on the programme. He is our international editor.

24:43.190 --> 24:46.650
We're going to move away from our top story. We will return to it later on in the programme though.

24:46.870 --> 24:49.090
Isaac Fanon is here. He's going to give us some sports headlines.

24:49.330 --> 24:53.810
Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goes, but they finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League.

24:53.810 --> 24:58.310
Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th minute as City lost their second game

24:58.310 --> 25:02.490
in the Premier League in a row for the first time. That's happened in five years.

25:02.870 --> 25:07.470
European football's governing body UEFA has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel

25:07.470 --> 25:10.930
during the next fortnight amid increased tensions in the region.

25:11.130 --> 25:15.610
Israel were due to play Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv,

25:16.090 --> 25:19.670
but that game has been rescheduled and UEFA said it will assess the situation

25:19.670 --> 25:24.690
over the coming days to see whether Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo

25:24.690 --> 25:27.230
will still take place on the 15th of October.

25:27.850 --> 25:33.490
To athletics news next, Kenyan Kelvin Kipton shattered the men's marathon world record in Chicago.

25:33.770 --> 25:38.610
He beat his compatriot, Eli Kipchogo, his previous one up by more than 30 seconds

25:38.610 --> 25:43.090
and 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours and 35 seconds.

25:43.090 --> 25:49.070
Australia were out of the Rugby World Cup despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal

25:49.070 --> 25:52.770
in the final pool stage match. Fiji got a losing bonus point

25:52.770 --> 25:59.030
and they qualify at Australia's expense due to their 22-15 victory way back in September.

25:59.730 --> 26:01.030
Isaac, thank you very much indeed.

26:01.830 --> 26:08.410
Now we are going to turn to Afghanistan because thousands of people in the west of the country

26:08.410 --> 26:13.010
are spending a second night in the open after a strong earthquake on Saturday

26:13.010 --> 26:15.230
reduced entire villages to rubble.

26:15.510 --> 26:19.730
There's been confusion about the number of dead with Taliban officials apologizing

26:19.730 --> 26:23.910
for an early assessment that more than 2,000 people had died.

26:24.150 --> 26:29.130
The United Nations humanitarian agency says that more than 1,000 have been killed

26:29.130 --> 26:31.350
and more than 500 are still missing.

26:31.830 --> 26:36.270
I'm now joined by my colleague from the Afghan service, Angela Gehr.

26:36.270 --> 26:37.690
Good morning to you, Angela.

26:38.170 --> 26:41.610
What is the latest that you can tell us about this devastating event?

26:42.870 --> 26:44.070
Good morning.

26:45.390 --> 26:54.370
The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is actually I can say that is a very, very, very big.

26:59.510 --> 27:04.510
The darkest time that we are experiencing in Afghanistan,

27:04.510 --> 27:12.210
the number that the Taliban are trying to share with the media is very different

27:12.210 --> 27:16.030
what we have receiving from the people.

27:16.690 --> 27:26.410
I think in that area we had more than 20 violence which are completely destroyed

27:28.030 --> 27:30.430
in the health care.

27:31.510 --> 27:36.810
And also there is no way for the people, actually in the first half

27:36.810 --> 27:40.490
when the Taliban tried to control the media, we didn't receive

27:41.210 --> 27:46.510
actually we felt that everything is not that bad

27:46.510 --> 27:54.970
what we sent the volunteers group to the area

27:54.970 --> 27:58.190
and actually I'm so sorry.

27:58.730 --> 27:59.950
No, don't worry.

28:00.190 --> 28:04.230
And so, Angela, basically the Taliban have gone back to what they said,

28:04.270 --> 28:09.210
the numbers have changed, but what are people saying on the ground, those who have been affected?

28:10.910 --> 28:16.390
They don't accept the numbers which the Taliban is sharing

28:17.390 --> 28:23.210
actually and also I think more than 2,000 people are killed

28:23.210 --> 28:32.150
1,000 people displaced and 1,000 people are missing in this crisis

28:32.790 --> 28:36.730
and we have nothing at that moment.

28:37.190 --> 28:44.510
At this moment, there are no big, big affair or support from the Taliban

28:44.510 --> 28:53.090
for the people just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help

28:53.210 --> 28:58.330
for the people and the volunteers group from Angela and other cities.

28:58.530 --> 29:02.930
Thank you so much for coming on to the program telling us about the devastating earthquake

29:02.930 --> 29:05.810
that has shaken Afghanistan in the rest of the country.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.750
