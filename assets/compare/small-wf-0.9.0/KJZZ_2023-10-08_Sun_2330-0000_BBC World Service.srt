00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,080
Israel is responding to Hamas' surprise attacks at the weekend with a series of airstrikes

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,640
in Gaza.

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,180
Palestinian health officials say more than 400 people have been killed.

4
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,160
Israel says that more than 700 of its citizens have died in the attacks so far, we get the

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,400
latest from both sides.

6
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,420
BBC News with Emily Thomas

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,380
The Israeli military has said its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over

8
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,500
500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,200
Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,460
Israel two days after they carried out a devastating mass assault.

11
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,780
More than 700 Israelis have been killed.

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,740
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes before

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,880
the latest barrage.

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,660
Hamas said it had fired missiles targeting Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,700
Three U.S. air carriers as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates have suspended services

16
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,900
to Tel Aviv, but some evacuation flights have taken place from the airport.

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,600
The UN Security Council has held an emergency meeting in New York to discuss the crisis behind

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,300
closed doors.

19
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,680
The UN Middle East envoy called on all countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,740
In other news, an independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into allegations

21
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,020
that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan between

22
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,640
2010 and 2013.

23
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,360
The inquiry was set up after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,100
The U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is leading a bipartisan delegation to China,

25
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,300
has met the foreign minister Wang Yi.

26
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,260
Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit as Washington seeks to

27
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,180
ease tensions with Beijing.

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,540
Mr Wang said he hoped the visit would help the U.S. to view its relationship with

29
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,620
China in a more objective way.

30
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,640
In Ecuador, the state of emergency has been extended by 30 days.

31
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,880
It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,100
candidate Fernando Villavicencio.

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,540
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,380
found dead in prison.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,020
BBC News.

36
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,960
We start this half hour of the programme with the latest developments in Gaza and Israel.

37
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,480
It is now two days since Hamas militants launched a wave of attacks against Israel.

38
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,020
Hamas runs Gaza, where more than two million Palestinians live, and Hamas is also designated

39
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,020
as a terror group by much of the Western world.

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,720
The death toll continues to rise.

41
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,480
700 Israelis have been killed and over 2,000 injured.

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,240
In retaliation, Israel has launched air strikes on the Gaza Strip, which have killed at least

43
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,940
413 people, and battles are continuing inside Israel between the Israeli Defence

44
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,160
Forces and Hamas fighters.

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,480
For the latest, I've been talking to a spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces,

46
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,000
Masha Mickelson.

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,760
And I asked if there are still fighters in Israel at the moment.

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,480
Yes, there are.

49
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,280
There's fighting still going on in several points in the community surrounding the Gaza

50
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,060
Strip. We're talking about Bari, Raim, Kfar Azad, the Zikim military base.

51
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:21,440
There's ongoing combat, and it's something that takes hours, multiple hours, to clear

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,000
those terrorists out.

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,980
And the idea is focusing right now on getting the southern part of Israel back to normal

54
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,220
without terrorists on Israeli soil.

55
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,400
How long do you think it will take to get it back to normal?

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,540
It's hard to say.

57
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,460
We hoped we would be in a better situation by the end of yesterday,

58
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,540
but there's still fighting going on.

59
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,860
This is our main objective throughout the day, to save as many lives as possible,

60
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,520
and get the terrorists out of Israel, whatever it takes.

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,020
While we're doing that, IDF aircraft are striking in Gaza hundreds of military

62
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,500
Hamas terrorist targets.

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:09,760
We have seen around 880 targets that have been struck, including terror tunnels.

64
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,520
That's, of course, in response to over 3,300 rockets that were fired from the Gaza Strip

65
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,340
in addition to the invasion.

66
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm going to come back to the airstrikes in just a moment.

67
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,120
Do you know whether there are still Hamas fighters entering Israel,

68
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,180
or is that boundary between Israel and the Gaza Strip secure?

69
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,360
There are Hamas people trying to infiltrate Israel.

70
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,020
Yes, still as we speak, they're being met with fire from IDF UAVs that are

71
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,500
surveilling the area of the border.

72
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,340
When they entered two days ago in the morning,

73
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,280
they blew up significant parts of the fence.

74
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,540
So there are still breached points of the fence that we are securing through the year.

75
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,440
Do you know how many people have been abducted and taken from Israel to Gaza?

76
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,160
We don't have the exact numbers, but it's in the dozens.

77
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,620
Right. We spoke to one family an hour ago on this program.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,380
They think that five members of their family, including an eight-year-old girl, have been taken.

79
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,340
And they contacted us because they were worried that the authorities were not doing

80
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,580
all they could to try to secure their return.

81
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,640
If you don't know exactly how many people have been taken,

82
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,680
do you have any idea where these people are and what are you intending to do

83
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,120
to try to secure their release?

84
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,840
We've seen documentation of hostages being held in Gaza in apartments and basements.

85
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,980
They're spread through multiple locations as far as we know.

86
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,580
The top officers in the military are currently presenting the political echelon

87
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,480
in the security cabinet for the past two days with plausible military options to go forward.

88
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,700
And of course, the hostages and their possible locations are being taken into account

89
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,840
as we decide what our next step is.

90
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,920
Israel is a state that holds human life sacred and we will do everything in our power

91
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,820
to ensure that they're coming back home safe.

92
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,520
But this is who Hamas is.

93
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,760
For years, they have been saying that this is their goal to eliminate the Jewish state,

94
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,940
to kill as many Jewish people as possible, to kidnap Jewish people.

95
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,280
And 48 hours ago, they showed their true face to the world.

96
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,720
Let's talk about the airstrikes.

97
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,560
You said that Hamas targets and tunnels that allow Hamas fighters to get from Gaza into Israel

98
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,980
have been hit by airstrikes, but also residential tower blocks have and mosques as well.

99
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,340
And we hear that more than 400 people have been killed, including children.

100
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,860
So Palestinian civilians are being killed and injured in these airstrikes, aren't they?

101
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:02,280
We're at war. The IDF targets, military targets that are used by Hamas.

102
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:10,320
Now, if Hamas treats their civilians for years as human shields, hiding ammunition

103
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,640
storages, hiding rocket launchers beneath schools, beneath mosques,

104
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,460
beneath UN facilities and kindergartens, we've seen how they treat Israeli citizens that they have

105
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,180
kidnapped. The IDF strikes targets that we have intelligence on that are being used by

106
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,360
Hamas for terrorism. And the way that Hamas acts is entrenching themselves cynically

107
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,300
within civilian population to make these actions more complicated for the IDF.

108
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,280
Of course, we are aware of that, but we are at war.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,100
Masha Mickelson, the spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces, and I mentioned a family

110
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,460
in that interview, too, that IDF spokesperson who are waiting for news on five relatives who

111
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,900
have been abducted by Hamas fighters. We're going to play the interview with one of

112
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,420
those family members later on in the program.

113
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,500
Well, the number of Palestinians killed in the violence has also continued to rise.

114
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,620
Health officials in Gaza said there is more than 400 deaths so far, and over 2,000 people

115
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,180
have been injured, as Israel launches more air strikes on the territory. The Israeli air force

116
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,960
says that it struck over 500 terrorist targets in Gaza overnight.

117
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,900
Well, for more, we are now joined by Professor Lina Katibi, who is the director

118
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,820
of the Middle East Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies University here

119
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,360
in London. Good morning to you and welcome to Newsday.

120
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,700
In your opinion, why do you think Hamas militants launched the operation in the first place?

121
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:48,860
The main reason is, of course, to try to put an end to the Israeli occupation that has been

122
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,760
going on for many, many, many years. The situation in Gaza in particular is really

123
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,900
very tough. It's been under siege for almost two decades, and Hamas wants to present itself

124
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,640
to the Palestinians as the entity that can make a difference in that regard.

125
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,800
So we have to remember here that the main goal for Hamas is political behind this military

126
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,180
operation. It's not to just call short-term destabilization. It's actually to say this is

127
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:32,500
a game-changing attack that puts Hamas as the central Palestinian entity for the world to kind of

128
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,580
engage with. But then one would wonder with this attack and seeing so many Palestinians dead and

129
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,580
obviously the ongoing fighting is still on. How much support does that leave Hamas

130
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,880
where we're in Gaza and among Palestinians?

131
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,100
Actually Hamas now enjoys wide support for this attack. People are very aware of the high price

132
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,820
that will be paid because of course Israel's retaliation is not going to be mild. And yet

133
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:10,360
they are so desperate that they feel they have nothing to lose. So that's why you're seeing

134
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,560
not just in Gaza but even wider in the Arab world a lot of support expressed for Hamas.

135
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:26,500
I think the Israel-Palestine conflict had been ignored for so long internationally that people

136
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,200
feel desperate measures are needed. And you said that there's even more wide

137
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,020
support for Hamas in the region as such. But looking at all that, we're not only

138
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,280
talking about infrastructures. There are lives and people who are being killed and injured and some

139
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:49,460
will be probably hostages. I wonder then in your opinion where does this go? How does this get

140
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:57,320
solved if anyone at all? The only way to resolve the situation is to resolve the Israel-Palestine

141
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,260
conflict. I mean without the conflict having been protracted for many many years,

142
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,620
Hamas would not have existed in the first place. I mean we have to remember in the 70s and 80s,

143
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:17,540
early 80s there was no Hamas. It was Fatah, the PLO and some other groups. But Hamas is a

144
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,080
relative newcomer in the history of the conflict and a product of the kind of stagnation

145
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,520
of this conflict politically. So the only way to resolve this is to go back to politics

146
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:38,080
and find a solution that is acceptable to Palestinians. I think you know these kinds of

147
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:45,120
groups like Hamas basically find an opening in protracted conflict and try to assert themselves

148
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,040
as a result. So we need the US back on track, we need the UK, we need the international community

149
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,720
at large to take this conflict seriously. We've already seen regional actors like Saudi Arabia

150
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,160
saying they are serious about wanting to find a solution to this conflict as well. So I think

151
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,160
this is the only way out. It's not about a military victory for anybody. It has to be

152
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,040
a political solution that restores peace. And briefly if you may, where does this leave

153
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,960
then the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in those conversations about a solution?

154
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:29,580
One of the things that is being achieved also by Hamas in this attack is to show

155
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:36,060
the weakness of the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas. I think he's going to face

156
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:43,920
increasing criticism from Palestinians about the failures of his leadership. And it is likely that

157
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:51,080
in the aftermath of this attack, the Palestinian Authority will seek to find another leader

158
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:57,420
to replace Abbas, although it's not clear who that leader could be because there has not been a clear

159
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,700
succession plan. But definitely something needs to change in that regard as well.

160
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,940
Professor Lina Khatib, thank you for coming on to the program. She is the director of the

161
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,540
Middle East Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies University here in London.

162
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,880
Well, aid and refugee groups are already warning that civilians on both sides have paid and will

163
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,580
continue to pay the heaviest price. More than 123,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza so far,

164
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,960
with close to 74,000 seeking shelter in schools, according to the United Nations.

165
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,440
Well, on the line now from Jerusalem is Shayna Lowe of the Norwegian Refugee Council.

166
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,980
Welcome to Newsday, Shayna. What are your teams on the ground telling you?

167
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:49,640
Good morning. Yes, I just spoke to my colleague in Gaza about an hour ago. Last night was a

168
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,960
terrifying night full of bombardments. My colleague Yusef has two young children,

169
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,200
and they are doing all that they can to protect their children, distract them from what's going

170
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:07,540
on outside their windows. The night for them is, of course, the scariest time of day because

171
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,460
they just do not know what will happen, and it's when Israeli airstrikes really ramp up.

172
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,060
In terms of our ability to operate on the ground in Gaza, we can't right now. Our staff has been

173
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,200
told to shelter in place and take care of themselves and their families. And so we're

174
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,640
desperately waiting for a cessation of the hostilities in order for our staff to be

175
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,840
able to go out and assess the damage and provide needs and provide assistance

176
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:42,180
to those who are in need. So even as the UN says more than 120,000 Palestinians currently don't

177
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:48,960
have a home, you're unable to help them? Exactly. I mean, so long as there's

178
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,820
ongoing hostilities, we cannot, in good conscience, we have a duty of care to our staff,

179
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:03,040
and we cannot send them out to go and provide assistance until we know that they can reach

180
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,560
communities safely. Right. I see. What are you hearing from your team in Israel?

181
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:16,360
Well, we actually don't operate in Israel. We operate only in occupied Palestinian territory,

182
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,000
so that includes the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and then also in the Gaza Strip.

183
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,880
Right. Now, we know that the food situation was already stretched in Gaza before

184
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,620
Saturday's events. What is your message to the international community about the kinds of help

185
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,160
that is needed, and what is the likelihood that that help will be able to get through?

186
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,640
Yeah. I mean, we need to have demands from the international community to call for,

187
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,540
if not a cessation of the hostilities, at least a pause in which humanitarian actors

188
00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:00,300
can access Gaza and provide assistance. I understand that yesterday the crossing with

189
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,500
Egypt was open and that some truckloads of food came in, but the reality in Gaza is that food

190
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:13,180
supplies are always very short. There's not a lot of extra food that is stockpiled there,

191
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,800
and so we, of course, are calling for a cessation of the hostilities so that

192
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,760
the international community, humanitarian organizations can bring in additional supplies

193
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,020
for Palestinians in need. We heard from a spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces

194
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,600
earlier on the program who was clear that if there is a location where they believe there is a

195
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,760
Hamas fighter or leader, they will target that location. So what is your message to civilians

196
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,240
in Gaza about whether they're at home or if they're displaced, but what they should do,

197
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,540
where they should go? I mean, the reality is that there is no safe place in Gaza.

198
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,040
For 16 years, Gaza has been besieged. Palestinians living there have very little ability to get

199
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:03,220
out or move. It's one of the most densely populated places on earth. 2.2 million people

200
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:10,200
are living there. And so when we hear remarks from Benjamin Netanyahu calling for Palestinians

201
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,700
in Gaza to leave, our question is, where should they go? Because Israel controls

202
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:24,740
people's exit from the Gaza Strip into Israel. Yes, exactly. And the Egyptian border,

203
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:31,000
my understanding is that it was open yesterday. For people to leave or not, do you know?

204
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,220
Well, people can leave, but it's cost prohibitive. So the Egyptian authorities

205
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,620
control the cost of exiting into Egypt. And my understanding is that they have increased that

206
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:52,260
cost considerably. And there are limitations in terms of the capacity that they have at this time

207
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,840
to be letting people flee for safety. All right. Thanks very much. That's

208
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,380
Shayna Lowe there from the Norwegian Refugee Council, who was on the line from Jerusalem.

209
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,200
And joining us back in the studio is Isaac Fennin with All This Fool.

210
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:14,260
Arsenal got a massive 1-0 win over Manchester City in the Premier League. Gabriela Martinelli

211
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,920
scoring the win. It was Ghana's first win in City in the League since 2015. Here's their manager,

212
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,720
Miquel Arteta. It's been a long time since the club hasn't beat Man City. And we discussed

213
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,080
that a lot. And we felt like today could be the day, but we needed a big performance,

214
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,360
huge individual performances. And we had that. And with a bit of luck, we managed to win the game.

215
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,320
For City, it's two defeats in the row in the Premier League for the first time in five years.

216
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,240
But manager Pep Guardiola says it's not the time to panic.

217
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,660
We're in October. People say, OK, this year is not going to happen. We're not going to

218
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,040
win the Premier League four times in a row. Listen, no team in all history have won

219
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,520
four times in a row. But we are in October. And from experience as a manager, this is a long,

220
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,200
long road. European football's governing body UEFA has postponed. All matches scheduled

221
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,260
in Israel during the next fortnight amid increased tension in the region.

222
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:13,980
Israel were due to play Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv. But that game has

223
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,520
been rescheduled. And UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days to see

224
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,400
whether Israel's European championship qualifier in Kosovo can take place in October.

225
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,380
Simone Biles secured another two gold medals at the World Gymnastics Championships. Her 22nd

226
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,920
and 23rd, she won the beam and four titles to add to the team. And all around success

227
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:43,240
earlier on in the competition, she's got four gold medals on her return to the sport. She

228
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,820
is the most decorated gymnast in the sports history. And she's done all this,

229
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,800
having taken some time off after the Tokyo Olympics to focus on her mental health.

230
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,640
It hasn't been easy. I've been focusing a lot on my gymnastics and my mental,

231
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,040
going to therapy, making sure that's in my regular scheduled routine as of anything else.

232
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,320
But I'm really proud of the work that I put in because at the beginning of the year, I

233
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,320
wasn't sure I was going to be competing. And I actually wasn't supposed to be competing.

234
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,600
So to end up here now at Worlds at the end of the year, it's just like,

235
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,280
I just keep amazing myself.

236
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,740
There was a huge result in the Rugby World Cup as Portugal beat Fiji 24-23

237
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,740
to claim their first ever win at their first ever World Cup. Here's their player, Nicholas Martin.

238
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:33,420
Something incredible. I work a lot for that. I have nowhere to say that it's historic.

239
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,600
I'm so happy. I think it's the best moment of my life.

240
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:46,960
We are a team of friends from France, from Portugal, but we live together. It's something incredible.

241
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,160
Now despite their second loss of the group phase, Fiji are still

242
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,320
through to the quarter-finals. They will play England next weekend in Marseille.

243
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,540
And finally, Kenyon, Kelvin, Kiptum shattered the men's marathon world record

244
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,680
in Chicago as he beat Kampatria-Ellid, Kipchoge's previous mark

245
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:12,140
by more than 30 seconds. The 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours and 35 seconds.

246
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,280
Isaac Fennin, thank you so much for that news about the sporting world. Now this is news there

247
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,940
with Vic and Rob in other news this morning. An independent inquiry in the UK will begin

248
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,180
hearings today into allegations that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians

249
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:40,360
in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2013. The inquiry was set up after legal action was brought by two

250
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,080
Afghan families. The US state majority leader, Chuck Schumer, who is leading a bipartisan

251
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,900
delegation to China, has met with the foreign minister Wang Yi. Mr. Schumer is the latest high

252
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,040
level American official to visit as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing. Mr. Wang said

253
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:04,020
he hoped that the visit would help the US to view its relationship with China in a more objective

254
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:10,940
way. And in Ecuador, the state of emergency has been extended by 30 days. It's been in place

255
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,320
since the assassination in August of anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Vila Citencio.

256
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,200
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing who are found dead in

257
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,280
prison. Now we're going to return to our main story now. It is more than 48 hours after Saturday's

258
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:34,540
unprecedented assault by fighters belonging to Hamas, which is designated as a terror organization by

259
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:41,280
Wani Western nations on Israel. And Hamas claims to have abducted more than 100 Israelis

260
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:47,220
with many taken over the boundary from Israel into Gaza. Some of them are believed to be Israeli

261
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,720
soldiers and many are civilians. Well, we've been contacted by a family anxious to know about the

262
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,020
fate of their five relatives who've been taken away from the Kibbutz of Nahos, which is a few

263
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:04,300
kilometers from Gaza. And I spoke on Sunday night to Yadin, who told me more about her missing

264
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:10,120
relatives. And she says she watched a Facebook live video in which she could see them being

265
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,660
taken, she thought, across the boundary into Gaza by these abductors.

266
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:47,360
If people didn't open the door and listen to them, they just shut the door and shut the people

267
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,620
whichever they want and took the rest in captivity. We don't know if they took them

268
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,800
across the border or just leave them there. We have no idea. And you could see all of this on

269
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:07,500
the video on Facebook. Yeah, it's 30 minutes live. Other than that, we just lost contact. So

270
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,940
there is no service or anything you can reach them. They are two little kids, two little daughters

271
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:20,020
of the partner who we don't know where they are. If they are together, if somebody is taking care

272
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:27,400
of them, there is another child who is 17 years old. It's a frightening situation. You said that

273
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,240
your aunt's partner appeared to have been shot in the leg. Was it clear from the video

274
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,460
whether he'd been given any medical care and how did the others in the video look?

275
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:48,120
One of the many videos that we saw is we saw Noam, the aunt's partner taking people of the

276
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,180
Hamas, is helping him walk through the border. Like for a two second shot, you could see it.

277
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:01,120
Other than that, we don't know anything. We just saw him walking very poorly.

278
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:07,360
How does that make you feel knowing that they've been taken or suspecting they've been taken to Gaza?

279
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:15,400
Terrible. All I can think is why the hell should I know they are being kept in Gaza via

280
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,880
channel Instagram. Presumably you've called your aunt's phone. Does it ring? Does anybody answer?

281
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:34,520
Actually, at the beginning, when some people try to text her, the Hamas answered the phone and wrote

282
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:42,000
in English. But other than that, when we try to call now, there is no line. You don't reach

283
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,980
to anything. It's ringing, but nobody answered. Have you spoken to the police? Have you spoken

284
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:53,880
to people in the army? We try. Even during the library, we call the authorities and they all say

285
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,460
they are aware of the problem and they really don't have something to do right now. It is a chaos.

286
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,600
It is really a chaos. It was a chaos. It's still a chaos. People don't know how to manage.

287
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,880
It was really a surprise attack. People don't know how to manage the situation.

288
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,880
What do you and the rest of the family want the authorities to do when it comes to your

289
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,640
aunt's partner and his children? We want to bring them home safe, no matter what the price is.

290
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:32,040
I think we all, the toll they took from us, we have 700 people killed,

291
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:43,560
thousands of people injured, not several injured, wounded very hard. It's not supposed to be in

292
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,640
civilians' people. Civilians shouldn't be paying this price.

293
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,700
Your family is clearly going through a very worrying, harrowing time at the moment.

294
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,460
What is it like being an Israeli right now? It's a bit disappointing. It's a bit hard.

295
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:07,040
It's unknown. You don't know what's going to be tomorrow. Is there a big attack also from

296
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:14,260
Hezbollah? Things are going to cool down. Somebody is going to take care of all the people who

297
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:21,620
got injured, who is not home, who is dead. There is so many questions you need to be asked and

298
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,320
I don't know. You feel a lot of things right now in Israel, but we all feel very divided.

299
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:37,640
That was Yadin who didn't want us to use her surname talking about her aunt and her partner

300
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,460
and their children, including eight-year-old Ella, who they watched being

301
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,880
abducted by Hamas fighters on a Facebook Live video on Saturday. We did put her point that

302
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,160
the authorities had done very little in her view. To the Israeli military spokesperson we had on

303
