369170	370290	BBC News
394230	402130	We are starting with the latest development in Israel in Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.
402550	409370	The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall, with more than 2,000 injured.
409370	419570	The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.
420010	427670	The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.
427670	439810	In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip, with more than 2,000 wounded, according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.
440810	450730	Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale destruction, shops are closed, the streets are empty, the city is said to be like a ghost town.
450730	462990	According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have now been displaced in Gaza because of the airstrikes, and many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.
463150	466370	In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.
466370	486690	The last couple of days were harrowing, and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge, because it's a very highly dense, populated area with very limited geographical area, like with over 2 million people living in 360 kilometers
486690	506350	square, which make each and every missile dropped very impactful and damaging. The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing, decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian land
506350	514350	and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.
514350	540270	Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians, refusing its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison
540270	552610	with restrictions on right to movement, right to health, and many other associated basic rights. Yet we were told as civilians to leave, I mean, leave and go where.
553830	562430	No crossings are open, neither the sea. That is also a restriction to some point. If you trespass, you can be shot.
562430	584410	For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed, including women, children, elderly and persons with disabilities. I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school shelters that not even fully prepare or accommodate these numbers and provide for their needs.
584410	612710	I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws and conflicts and its principles. These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and civilians, avoid disproportionate use of force and have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies for the population.
612710	637850	And now there is limited electricity and crossings are fully closed to let in any supplies. But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles. And the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.
637850	652370	A resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like. And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com for a slash news. There is a live page of being updated as we get more news.
652370	664450	Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism, a former member of the Knessetli-Israeli parliament, Mikhail Kotlovich. Thanks so much for joining us.
665430	666870	Thank you so much for having me.
666870	669070	How are Israelis feeling today?
670330	699050	You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is, it actually encourages me to ask you the question, because, you know, when I hear the framing of what is happening in Israel, where a genocidal terror organization holding 2 million civilians in Gaza, alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were in our home.
699050	714670	In our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel, 5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza. Each rocket, a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.
714670	739570	When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260, at least, young party goers on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the anti-Semitic terror organization, Hamas, actually designated as a terror organization funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran,
739570	759670	holding its own civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza, in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West, that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.
759670	779590	So I would turn the question to you, if this were happening anywhere else in the world, not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians, but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians, where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians
779590	805610	in holding families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip of entire families being butchered in their homes and to hear the way that the framing, that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.
805610	821690	Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives on this as we can. I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got a sense from you of the anger there is and the sadness too.
821830	826170	No, there is no anger. We are fighting for our lives. There is no anger. Let it be clear.
826170	834410	You said that this is like Israel's 9-11. Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?
835230	846590	It's not just because of this shock. It's because of the same modus operandi. This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us at the moment.
846590	859970	Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that must defend its citizens from terror. You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand what Israelis are feeling.
859970	878450	There is no both sides when a terror organization ravages civilian areas, enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians, breaking barriers, that there is a fence, there has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.
879570	881770	There has been a blockade though, hasn't there of Gaza?
917010	925470	How do you think the Israeli military should respond then? We've seen, I told more than 500 airstrikes over the weekend.
927770	929990	My job is to ask questions, not answer them.
955870	973970	To my question, how do you think the military should respond? There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza, although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment. Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government to go?
973970	986010	There are dozens of Israeli hostages and many of them are civilians that were abducted, many of them raped, many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated.
986010	996730	And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must the citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak.
997350	1009470	And every country that cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught, massacre of its civilians.
1009470	1026450	And those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization, and I want to make it very clear alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers and two civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.
1026450	1043470	And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries must call for the immediate and unconditional return because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.
1043970	1052310	And what the IDF will have to do and the state of Israel will have to do in its existential war is not just about the state of Israel. I want to make it very clear to your listeners.
1052310	1055550	Mikaela, Katla, Vunch, we've got to leave it there. Thanks for joining us.
1056390	1068150	Well, staying with this story and looking at the business side of things, one industry that's already filling the impact of this conflict is the aviation industry with dozens of flights already cancelled.
1068650	1074430	Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore, Keti Silva. Keti, what are we seeing?
1075590	1084870	Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines cancelling flights. The likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair all cancelled journeys.
1085350	1093950	British Airways for its part told the BBC that it's only cancelled one flight on Sunday and that it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days.
1094070	1101450	And that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport or if perhaps they want to land at different times of the day that may be deemed safer.
1101450	1109430	Many of these airlines are also offering passengers to cancel their flights or to move the dates with no sort of change fees.
1110210	1116150	Flights to Israel's second international airport, Iliad, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea, they've been unaffected.
1116390	1127370	But we've also heard that Israelis flag carrier LL, it's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now, but again allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.
1127370	1133550	But get to this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying or desperately trying to leave.
1134670	1145630	Oh, to leave as well as to get home. So that's one of the major issues is that many have found themselves stranded and with fears about whether or not the airspace will be closed.
1145950	1152570	So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there amongst them stranded in Cyprus, Atlanta International Airport late last night.
1153330	1157510	Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights home.
1158250	1161850	As I say, rumors about whether or not the country may close its airspace.
1162370	1168010	It was hard to get tickets, we understand. Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights.
1168830	1171090	And getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.
1171530	1180670	In terms of leaving the country, I've heard, for example, as well from Athens, the foreign ministry, saying that's working to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.
1180670	1184630	Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece.
1184850	1189650	But there is indeed much concern about many of the foreign workers in Israel.
1189830	1193310	I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel.
1193550	1198130	And so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home if indeed they want to leave Israel.
1198570	1204190	All right, Katie Silver always a pleasure to have you on the program, our business correspondent there in Singapore.
1204190	1210470	And we are remaining with this story and we are now going to speak to our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
1211110	1216470	Good morning to you, Jeremy. Now, you have called this a major Middle East crisis.
1216790	1218750	Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?
1219830	1229230	Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas has been able to break out of Gaza,
1229230	1235190	which is surrounded by, if you like, a ring of steel, of fences, wire fences and concrete,
1235850	1242590	break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis, including many, many civilians.
1243490	1247410	That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before.
1248030	1254590	And it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma and plenty of people here
1255230	1258550	compare it to the 9-11 attacks in the United States.
1259230	1264310	There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that if you adjust the death toll for population,
1265430	1269530	it's equivalent of the Americans losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.
1269810	1278990	So it's a big, big event and the Israeli response, which is going to be, is already very heavy military action,
1279130	1282530	but I think there'll be a land invasion too of Gaza.
1283330	1288370	Now that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region.
1289230	1292090	And to really unexplored territory right now.
1292870	1296670	And Jeremy, you have been in the region, you have been in the area.
1296910	1303570	Just for our listeners' benefit, can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like and how that area is to Israel?
1305970	1314870	Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast, which is surrounded mostly by Israel,
1314870	1320950	but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.
1323250	1328850	The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.
1329470	1336790	Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948,
1337170	1340710	a time that the Palestinians called the Nakba, the catastrophe.
1341470	1345190	And it's an area where people are mostly very poor.
1345550	1348770	They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.
1349230	1351670	They're mostly not allowed to leave the area.
1352270	1355630	There are plenty of adults there who've never left.
1356770	1364070	And so it is a situation which is, life there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic.
1364070	1369850	And since 2007, it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas,
1370010	1373590	which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement.
1374030	1380730	And you wrote a nice read on our website where you said that Hamas blindsided Israel
1380730	1384330	with what you call the most serious attack in a generation.
1384730	1389850	And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken, including civilians as well as soldiers.
1389850	1395750	What sort of challenge does this pose for the government of Mr Netanyahu and the army going forward?
1396730	1405730	It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government has, I think, faced probably for 50 years since the 1973 Middle East War.
1408250	1415890	His political enemies are already blaming him, saying that he took his afterball for a variety of reasons.
1416610	1420930	It's clear that there's been, from the Israeli perspective, a huge intelligence failure.
1421630	1424370	And they're struggling militarily to assert themselves.
1424670	1430350	They will succeed in doing that. I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.
1431250	1439250	I think the big question, which was, and this is probably an equal challenge for the Israelis,
1439250	1441850	is what happens after that?
1442410	1447410	What happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?
1447730	1453250	Because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza and finally pulled out in 2005
1455310	1458170	do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation.
1458350	1464270	But if they sent in their troops, there's going to have to be some kind of governance of a territory
1464270	1470630	which is maybe small, but as I said, contains getting on for two and a half million people.
1472070	1476110	Jeremy Bowen there. Thank you for coming on the programme. He is our international editor.
1483190	1486650	We're going to move away from our top story. We will return to it later on in the programme though.
1486870	1489090	Isaac Fanon is here. He's going to give us some sports headlines.
1489330	1493810	Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goes, but they finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League.
1493810	1498310	Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th minute as City lost their second game
1498310	1502490	in the Premier League in a row for the first time. That's happened in five years.
1502870	1507470	European football's governing body UEFA has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel
1507470	1510930	during the next fortnight amid increased tensions in the region.
1511130	1515610	Israel were due to play Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv,
1516090	1519670	but that game has been rescheduled and UEFA said it will assess the situation
1519670	1524690	over the coming days to see whether Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo
1524690	1527230	will still take place on the 15th of October.
1527850	1533490	To athletics news next, Kenyan Kelvin Kipton shattered the men's marathon world record in Chicago.
1533770	1538610	He beat his compatriot, Eli Kipchogo, his previous one up by more than 30 seconds
1538610	1543090	and 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours and 35 seconds.
1543090	1549070	Australia were out of the Rugby World Cup despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal
1549070	1552770	in the final pool stage match. Fiji got a losing bonus point
1552770	1559030	and they qualify at Australia's expense due to their 22-15 victory way back in September.
1559730	1561030	Isaac, thank you very much indeed.
1561830	1568410	Now we are going to turn to Afghanistan because thousands of people in the west of the country
1568410	1573010	are spending a second night in the open after a strong earthquake on Saturday
1573010	1575230	reduced entire villages to rubble.
1575510	1579730	There's been confusion about the number of dead with Taliban officials apologizing
1579730	1583910	for an early assessment that more than 2,000 people had died.
1584150	1589130	The United Nations humanitarian agency says that more than 1,000 have been killed
1589130	1591350	and more than 500 are still missing.
1591830	1596270	I'm now joined by my colleague from the Afghan service, Angela Gehr.
1596270	1597690	Good morning to you, Angela.
1598170	1601610	What is the latest that you can tell us about this devastating event?
1602870	1604070	Good morning.
1605390	1614370	The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is actually I can say that is a very, very, very big.
1619510	1624510	The darkest time that we are experiencing in Afghanistan,
1624510	1632210	the number that the Taliban are trying to share with the media is very different
1632210	1636030	what we have receiving from the people.
1636690	1646410	I think in that area we had more than 20 violence which are completely destroyed
1648030	1650430	in the health care.
1651510	1656810	And also there is no way for the people, actually in the first half
1656810	1660490	when the Taliban tried to control the media, we didn't receive
1661210	1666510	actually we felt that everything is not that bad
1666510	1674970	what we sent the volunteers group to the area
1674970	1678190	and actually I'm so sorry.
1678730	1679950	No, don't worry.
1680190	1684230	And so, Angela, basically the Taliban have gone back to what they said,
1684270	1689210	the numbers have changed, but what are people saying on the ground, those who have been affected?
1690910	1696390	They don't accept the numbers which the Taliban is sharing
1697390	1703210	actually and also I think more than 2,000 people are killed
1703210	1712150	1,000 people displaced and 1,000 people are missing in this crisis
1712790	1716730	and we have nothing at that moment.
1717190	1724510	At this moment, there are no big, big affair or support from the Taliban
1724510	1733090	for the people just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help
1733210	1738330	for the people and the volunteers group from Angela and other cities.

1742930	1745810	that has shaken Afghanistan in the rest of the country.
