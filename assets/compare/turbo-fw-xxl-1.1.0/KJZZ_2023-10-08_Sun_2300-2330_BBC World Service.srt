Victoria Wohunda and Rob Young.

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:29,540
This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side, with more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza.

4
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,380
We hear from a woman in Gaza.

5
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,480
The last couple of days were harrowing, and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,960
Gaza's very highly dense populated area, with each and every missile very impactful and damaging.

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:53,260
In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival, the first site attacked by Hamas.

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,380
We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones

9
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,320
that has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.

10
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,800
And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000 people.

11
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,520
Rescue efforts are continuing.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,880
But first, we're getting a bulletin of world news.

13
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:25,630
The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over 500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

14
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,070
Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel,

15
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,690
two days after they carried out their devastating mass assault.

16
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,350
More than 700 Israelis have been killed.

17
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,230
John Donison is in Jerusalem.

18
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:46,450
The Israeli military says it has continued to target Hamas infrastructure, with airstrikes overnight.

19
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,750
The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced,

20
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,550
with many seeking shelter in UN schools.

21
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,270
But most believe this is just the beginning.

22
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:04,050
Israel is massing its forces around Gaza, and says it has called up around 100,000 army reservists.

23
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,710
Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion,

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,210
with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

25
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:19,750
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far by Israeli airstrikes.

26
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,890
Over 2,000 people have been injured.

27
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,570
They said power cuts were widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical workers.

28
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,110
Hamas said it had fired a new barrage of missiles into Israel.

29
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,710
Three U.S. air carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended flights to Tel Aviv.

30
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,750
The United States says it's sending immediate extra munitions to Israel.

31
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,630
The Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier, to the eastern Mediterranean.

32
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,550
More from Barbara Pletasha in Washington.

33
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:57,810
The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.

34
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,210
They're sending an aircraft carrier with a deck of warplanes, accompanied by cruisers and destroyers.

35
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,090
Also extra military assistance, such as munitions.

36
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,250
In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the fight.

37
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,850
It's backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas.

38
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,110
There are reports that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack,

39
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,990
although the Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.

40
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:30,090
The U.N. Security Council has held an emergency closed-door session to discuss the crisis.

41
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,850
The U.N. Middle East envoy called on countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.

42
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,170
More from Neda Taufik in New York.

43
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,790
Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement.

44
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,150
Not all, but many condemned Hamas.

45
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,690
The UAE's ambassador to the U.N., Lana Nusebe, told reporters there was real concern

46
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,410
that tensions in the region could become inflamed.

47
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,050
Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdogan,

48
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,810
showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.

49
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,630
The Palestinian U.N. ambassador, Riyad Mansour, told reporters he'd requested

50
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,710
an emergency meeting of Arab League states in Cairo.

51
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,090
BBC World News.

52
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:18,770
An independent inquiry in the U.K. will begin hearings today into allegations that British

53
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:23,810
special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians, including children, in Afghanistan.

54
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,630
The inquiry was set up by the British government after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.

55
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,070
The U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to China,

56
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,970
has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

57
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,250
Mr. Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.

58
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,610
Regional elections in two of Germany's largest and wealthiest states,

59
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,090
Bavaria and Hesse, have dealt a blow to the parties that form the centre-left federal government.

60
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,810
Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberal Free Democrats.

61
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,090
The Christian Democrats again emerge as the largest party.

62
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,970
The president of Ecuador has extended the state of emergency by 30 days.

63
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,150
It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential candidate,

64
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,030
Fernando Villavicencio. The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing

65
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,170
were found dead in prison.

66
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,950
A hoard of coins believed to have belonged to a Highland clan chief who was murdered more than 300 years ago

67
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,190
has been found in Scotland. Alexandra McKenzie reports.

68
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:39,090
The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the first major excavation in Glencoe.

69
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,530
The dig focused on scattered rocks, believed to have been the Macdonald clan chief's summer house.

70
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,250
More than 300 years after he died in the Glencoe massacre,

71
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,190
an archaeology student taking part in her first ever dig found the hoard.

72
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:59,090
The University of Glasgow said the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins.

73
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,770
A number of other artefacts were also discovered at the site,

74
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,450
including a musket and fouling shot, pottery from across Europe and a powder measure.

BBC News.

76
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,490
Thank you for that bulletin of news.

77
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,890
Hello, you're with Newsday from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wahunda and Rob Young.

78
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,470
Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue to focus on the conflict between Israel and Gaza

79
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,970
with voices from both sides and we'll get all your sports and business headlines too.

80
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:42,130
We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.

81
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:49,370
The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall, with more than 2,000 injured.

82
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:56,910
The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas militants

83
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,550
in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.

84
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,870
The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation

85
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,770
between the two sides for decades.

86
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:14,670
In retaliation, Israel launched air strikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip,

87
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:20,370
with more than 2,000 wounded, according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.

88
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,990
Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale destruction.

89
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,430
Shops are closed, the streets are empty.

90
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,750
The city is said to be like a ghost town.

91
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:38,790
According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have now been displaced in Gaza because of the air strikes.

92
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,970
And many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.

93
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,430
In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.

94
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:53,090
The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

95
00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:00,430
Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with very limited geographical area,

96
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:07,250
like with over 2 million people living in 360 kilometers square,

97
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,470
which makes each and every missile drop very impactful and damaging.

98
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:20,390
The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing,

99
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,430
decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian land

100
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:33,610
and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.

101
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:44,210
And meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians,

102
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:54,230
refusing population, its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive,

103
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:03,350
and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison with restrictions on right to movement,

104
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,130
right to health, and many other associated basic rights.

105
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,650
Yet we were told as civilians to leave. I mean, leave and go where?

106
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,570
No crossings are open, neither the sea. That is also have restriction to some point.

107
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,770
If you trespass, you can be shot. For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed,

108
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:33,770
including women, children, elderly, and persons with disabilities. I mean, thousands of people

109
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:40,830
are internally displaced to school shelters that are not even fully prepared or equipped to accommodate

110
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:48,530
these numbers and provide for their needs. I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian

111
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:54,910
laws and conflicts and its principles. These principles require Israel to respect the distinction

112
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:09,090
between competence and civilians, avoid disproportionate use of force, and have responsibility for the

113
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:22,850
humanitarian supplies for the population. And now there is limited electricity and crossings are fully

114
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:30,650
closed to let in any supplies. But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles.

115
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:37,910
And the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.

116
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,750
A resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like. And if you want to keep up

117
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:52,010
to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com forward slash news. There is a live page being updated as we get more

118
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,310
news.

119
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:58,710
Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism,

120
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:04,430
a former member of the Knessetly Israeli parliament, Michal Kotler-Wunsch. Thanks so much for joining us.

121
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,990
Thank you so much for having me on.

122
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,050
How are Israelis feeling today?

123
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,890
You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is,

124
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:24,470
it actually encourages me to ask you the question. Because, you know, when I hear the framing of what

125
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:31,370
is happening in Israel, where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in

126
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:38,130
Gaza, alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were

127
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:45,870
in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel, 5,000 rockets launched at

128
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:52,970
Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza. Each rocket, a double war crime and a violation

129
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:59,130
of international humanitarian law. When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately

130
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:09,130
shot 260 at least young party goers on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the anti-Semitic

131
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:17,530
terror organization, Hamas, actually designated as a terror organization, funded and supported by a

132
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:27,710
genocidal regime in Iran, holding its own civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza, in the same way

133
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:34,530
that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West, that genocidal terror cannot be

134
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:40,770
allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves. So I would turn the

135
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:46,870
question to you, if this were happening anywhere else in the world, not only for Israel's right to

136
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:53,410
defend its civilians, but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians, where the majority of those

137
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:04,870
those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians in a holding of families of Holocaust

138
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:12,010
survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip, of entire families being butchered in their homes.

139
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:20,070
And to hear the way that the framing, that BBC enables this situation, is actually part and

140
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:25,690
parcel of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.

141
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:32,730
Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives

142
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,690
on this as we can. I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got a sense from you of the

143
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:43,430
of the anger there is and the sadness too. No, there is no anger. We are fighting for our

144
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:50,450
lives. There is no anger. Let it be clear. You said that this is like Israel's 9-11.

145
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,410
Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?

146
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,570
It's not just because of this shock. It's because of the same modus operandi.

147
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:06,290
This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us at the

148
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:12,490
moment. Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that must defend its citizens

149
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:19,590
from terror. You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand what Israelis are

150
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:28,170
feeling. There is no both sides. When a terror organization ravages civilian areas, enters under

151
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:35,190
the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians, breaking barriers, that there is a fence. There has not

152
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:40,050
been any occupation of Gaza since 2005. And the voices that you are listening to...

153
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,750
There has been a blockade though, hasn't there, of Gaza?

154
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:47,990
No, no, there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every

155
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:54,910
day to work in Israel. There are thousands of truckloads. There is electricity and water still being supplied,

156
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:02,030
although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza because that's who was elected to reign over

157
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,470
Gaza. And there is a responsibility of the international community and of all those that cherish life and

158
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:14,610
liberty to hold Hamas to account for holding those two million civilians in Gaza hostage to their war

159
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,790
crimes, not only on Israel, but on Gaza's civilians.

160
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,690
How do you think the Israeli military should respond then? We've seen, we're told, more than 500

161
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,670
air strikes over the weekend. How do you think the Israeli military should... How do you think any

162
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,950
other countries should respond? Well, my job is to ask questions, not answer them.

163
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,590
Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect its civilians when they're

164
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:40,730
being attacked, including as we speak, in their homes, including as we speak. There is an ongoing

165
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:47,030
war here with genocidal terror. This is not two countries fighting each other. A genocidal

166
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:54,230
terror organization, ISIS, if you will, 9-11, needs moral clarity. And this is not just about Jews

167
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,250
around the world who are now under attack. So to my question, how do you think the military

168
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:04,210
should respond? There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza, although we're told

169
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:11,910
there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment. Do you think a ground invasion is

170
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:18,810
the way for the Israeli government to go? There are dozens of Israeli hostages and many of them are

171
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:25,390
civilians that were abducted, many of them raped, many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and

172
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:33,510
celebrated. And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect, as it must, the

173
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:41,530
citizens of the State of Israel under attack as we speak. And every country that cherishes life and

174
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:50,410
liberty must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught massacre of its civilians. And those

175
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,570
hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization. And I want to make

176
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,530
it very clear, alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers and two civilians that have been held by the same

177
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:06,510
genocidal terror organization in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.

178
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:12,110
And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries must call for the immediate and

179
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:19,290
unconditional return because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror

180
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:25,950
organization to hold those civilians hostage as we speak. And what the IDF will have to do and the

181
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,710
State of Israel will have to do in its existential war is not just about the State of Israel. I want

182
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,310
to make it very clear to your listeners.

183
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,550
Michal, Kakla, Wunsch, we've got to leave it there. Thanks for joining us.

184
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:41,670
Well, staying with this story and looking at the business side of things, one industry that's already

185
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:47,150
feeling the impact of this conflict is the aviation industry with dozens of flights

186
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,070
already cancelled. Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore,

187
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,410
Katie Silva. Katie, what are we seeing?

188
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,710
Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines cancelling flights, the likes, for example,

189
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,850
of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair all cancelled journeys.

190
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,210
British Airways, for its part, told the BBC that it's only cancelled one flight on Sunday

191
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,290
and that it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days. And that's

192
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,190
unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport or if perhaps they want to land

193
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,950
at different times of the day that may be deemed safer. Many of these airlines are also offering

194
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,530
passengers to cancel their flights or to move the dates with no sort of change fees.

195
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:35,090
Flights to Israel's second international airport, Iliat, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea,

196
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,090
they've been unaffected. But we've also heard that Israeli's flag carrier, El Al, it's said that it's

197
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,790
going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now, but again, allowing airlines and

198
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,490
passengers to change their flights.

199
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:53,710
But Katie, this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying or desperately trying to leave.

200
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,910
Oh, to leave as well as to get home. So that's one of the major issues is that

201
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,450
many have found themselves stranded and with fears about whether or not

202
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:08,270
the airspace will be closed. So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there

203
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,570
amongst them, stranded in Cyprus at Lanika International Airport late last night.

204
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,550
Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights home.

205
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,850
As I say, rumours about whether or not the country may close its airspace.

206
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,170
It was hard to get tickets, we understand. Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example,

207
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,090
for no shows on the fully booked flights. And getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.

208
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,210
In terms of leaving the country, we've heard, for example, as well, from Athens,

209
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,670
the foreign ministry saying that it's working to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.

210
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:47,070
Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece. But there is indeed much concern

211
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,890
about many of the foreign workers in Israel. I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000

212
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,370
workers in Israel. And so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens

213
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,130
home if indeed they want to leave Israel.

214
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,090
All right, Katie Silva. Always a pleasure to have you on the program, our business correspondent

215
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,130
there in Singapore. And we are remaining with this story and we are now going to speak to

216
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,930
our international editor, Jeremy Bowen. Good morning to you, Jeremy. Now, you have called this

217
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:18,750
a major Middle East crisis. Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?

218
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:29,270
Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas has been able to break out of Gaza,

219
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:35,290
which is surrounded by, if you like, a ring of steel, of fences, wire fences and concrete,

220
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:42,610
break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis, including many, many civilians.

221
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,450
That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before.

222
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:56,110
And it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma. And plenty of people here compare it to

223
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:02,110
the 9-11 attacks in the United States. There's even one article in one of the newspapers here

224
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,690
saying that if you adjust the death toll for population, it's the equivalent of the Americans

225
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:15,210
losing more than 20,000 on 9-11. So it's a big, big event. And the Israeli response,

226
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,050
which is going to be, is already very heavy military action, but I think there'll be

227
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:27,210
a land invasion, too, of Gaza. Now, that also is something that could have reverberations right

228
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,090
across the region. So we're into really unexplored territory right now.

229
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:38,650
And, Jeremy, you have been in the region, you have been in the area. Just for our listeners' benefit,

230
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,610
can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like and how that area is to Israel?

231
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:54,890
Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast, which is surrounded mostly by Israel,

232
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:01,490
but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.

233
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,870
The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.

234
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:15,170
Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes when Israel was created

235
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:20,690
in 1948, a time that the Palestinians call the Nakba, the catastrophe.

236
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:28,730
And it's an area where people are mostly very poor. They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.

237
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:35,670
They're mostly not allowed to leave the area. There are plenty of adults there who've never left.

238
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:43,990
And so it's some... it is a situation which is... life there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic.

239
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,890
And since 2007, it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas,

240
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,630
which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic resistance movement.

241
00:22:53,930 --> 00:23:00,730
And you wrote a nice read on our website where you said that, you know, Hamas blindsided Israel

242
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,330
with what you call most a serious attack in a generation.

243
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:09,930
And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken, including civilians as well as soldiers.

244
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:15,770
What sort of challenge does this pose for the government of Mr. Netanyahu and the army going forward?

245
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,710
It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government has, I think, faced probably

246
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:31,450
for 50 years since the 1973 Middle East war. He is... his political enemies are already blaming him,

247
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:38,110
saying that he took his eye off the ball for a variety of reasons. It's clear that there's been,

248
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,910
from the Israeli perspective, a huge intelligence failure. And they're struggling militarily to assert

249
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:49,610
themselves. They will succeed in doing that, I'm pretty certain, because Israel has got very powerful

250
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:58,850
armed forces. I think the big question, which was, and this is probably an equal challenge for the

251
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:07,390
Israelis, is what happens after that? How do they... what happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?

252
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:13,730
Because the Israelis, who used to occupy Gaza, and finally pulled out in 2005,

253
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,650
do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation. But if they sent in their troops,

254
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:25,530
they're going to... there's going to have to be some kind of governance of a territory, which is maybe

255
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:30,630
small, but as I said, contains getting on for two and a half million people.

256
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:36,070
Mm. Jeremy Bowen there. Thank you for coming on the program. He is our international editor.

257
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,430
We're going to move away from our top story. We will return to it later on in the program,

258
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,110
though. Isaac Fannin is here. He's going to give us some sports headlines.

259
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,770
Yeah, took Arsenal 12 goes, but they finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League.

260
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,330
Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th minute as City lost their second game

261
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,490
in the Premier League in a row for the first time that's happened in five years.

262
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,490
European football's governing body UEFA has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel

263
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,110
during the next fortnight amid increased tensions in the region. Israel were due to play

264
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:17,790
Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv, but that game has been rescheduled.

265
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,890
And UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days to see whether Israel's away

266
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,270
qualifier in Kosovo will still take place on the 15th of October.

267
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:33,550
To athletics news next, Kenyon Kelvin Kipton shattered the men's marathon world record in Chicago.

268
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,670
He beat his compatriot Eli Kipchoge's previous mark by more than 30 seconds.

269
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,110
A 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours, 35 seconds.

270
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:51,010
And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal in the final pool stage match.

271
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:57,530
Fiji got a losing bonus point and they qualify at Australia's expense due to their 22-15 victory

272
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,190
way back in September.

273
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,010
Isaac, thank you very much indeed.

274
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:08,390
Now, we are going to turn to Afghanistan because thousands of people in the west of the country

275
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:15,190
are spending a second night in the open after a strong earthquake on Saturday reduced entire villages to rubble.

276
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:20,970
There's been confusion about the number of dead with Taliban officials apologizing for an early assessment

277
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:28,170
that more than 2,000 people had died. The United Nations Humanitarian Agency says that more than 1,000

278
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:34,770
have been killed and more than 500 are still missing. I'm now joined by my colleague from the Afghan

279
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:40,490
service, Angela Gehr. Good morning to you, Angela. What is the latest that you can tell us about this

280
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:53,210
devastating event? Good morning. The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is actually I can say that is a very,

281
00:26:53,330 --> 00:27:08,590
very, very big... The darkest time that we are experiencing in Afghanistan, the number that the Taliban are trying to

282
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:15,990
share with you share with the media is very different from what we have receiving from the people.

283
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:26,410
I think in that area, we had more than 20 villages which are completely destroyed

284
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:36,790
in the earthquake. And also, there is no way for the... Actually, in the first half,

285
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:43,050
where the Taliban tried to control the media, we didn't receive the... Actually, we thought that everything

286
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:58,190
is not that bad what we... When we sent the volunteers group to the area and they... Actually, I'm so sorry.

287
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:04,210
I'm very... No, don't worry. And so, Angela, basically, the Taliban have gone back to what they said,

288
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,230
the numbers have changed. But what are people saying on the ground, those who've been affected?

289
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:21,290
They don't accept the numbers which the Taliban is sharing, actually. And also, I think more than

290
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:32,190
2,000 people are killed, 1,000 people displaced, and 1,000 people are missing in this crisis.

291
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:42,990
And we have nothing at that moment. At this moment, there are no big, big offer or support from

292
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:53,850
from the Taliban for the people. Just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help for the people,

293
00:28:53,850 --> 00:29:00,410
and the volunteers group from... Angela, thank you so much for coming on to the program,

294
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,810
telling us about the devastating earthquake that has shaken Afghanistan in the west of the country.

295
