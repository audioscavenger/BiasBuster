194850	199110	There are reports that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack,

369230	370450	BBC News.
373870	375490	Thank you for that bulletin of news.
375490	379890	Hello, you're with Newsday from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wahunda and Rob Young.
380070	384470	Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue to focus on the conflict between Israel and Gaza
384470	389970	with voices from both sides and we'll get all your sports and business headlines too.
394470	402130	We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.
402330	409370	The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall, with more than 2,000 injured.
409510	416910	The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas militants
416910	419550	in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.
419750	425870	The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation
425870	427770	between the two sides for decades.
428030	434670	In retaliation, Israel launched air strikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip,
434690	440370	with more than 2,000 wounded, according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.
440370	444990	Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale destruction.
445270	447430	Shops are closed, the streets are empty.
447430	450750	The city is said to be like a ghost town.
451070	458790	According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have now been displaced in Gaza because of the air strikes.
458990	462970	And many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.
463010	466430	In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.
466430	473090	The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.
473990	480430	Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with very limited geographical area,
481130	487250	like with over 2 million people living in 360 kilometers square,
487470	492470	which makes each and every missile drop very impactful and damaging.
492470	500390	The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing,
501110	506430	decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian land
506430	513610	and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.
513610	524210	And meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians,
526590	534230	refusing population, its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive,
534230	543350	and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison with restrictions on right to movement,
543650	547130	right to health, and many other associated basic rights.
547270	552650	Yet we were told as civilians to leave. I mean, leave and go where?
553370	559570	No crossings are open, neither the sea. That is also have restriction to some point.
559870	566770	If you trespass, you can be shot. For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed,
566810	573770	including women, children, elderly, and persons with disabilities. I mean, thousands of people
573770	580830	are internally displaced to school shelters that are not even fully prepared or equipped to accommodate
580830	588530	these numbers and provide for their needs. I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian
588530	594910	laws and conflicts and its principles. These principles require Israel to respect the distinction
594910	609090	between competence and civilians, avoid disproportionate use of force, and have responsibility for the
609090	622850	humanitarian supplies for the population. And now there is limited electricity and crossings are fully
622850	630650	closed to let in any supplies. But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles.
630990	637910	And the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.
638930	644750	A resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like. And if you want to keep up
644750	652010	to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com forward slash news. There is a live page being updated as we get more
652010	652310	news.
652570	658710	Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism,
658870	664430	a former member of the Knessetly Israeli parliament, Michal Kotler-Wunsch. Thanks so much for joining us.
665610	666990	Thank you so much for having me on.
667070	669050	How are Israelis feeling today?
670470	676890	You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is,
676890	684470	it actually encourages me to ask you the question. Because, you know, when I hear the framing of what
684470	691370	is happening in Israel, where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in
691370	698130	Gaza, alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were
698130	705870	in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel, 5,000 rockets launched at
705870	712970	Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza. Each rocket, a double war crime and a violation
712970	719130	of international humanitarian law. When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately
719130	729130	shot 260 at least young party goers on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the anti-Semitic
730010	737530	terror organization, Hamas, actually designated as a terror organization, funded and supported by a
737530	747710	genocidal regime in Iran, holding its own civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza, in the same way
747710	754530	that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West, that genocidal terror cannot be
754530	760770	allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves. So I would turn the
760770	766870	question to you, if this were happening anywhere else in the world, not only for Israel's right to
766870	773410	defend its civilians, but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians, where the majority of those
773410	784870	those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians in a holding of families of Holocaust
784870	792010	survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip, of entire families being butchered in their homes.
792010	800070	And to hear the way that the framing, that BBC enables this situation, is actually part and
800070	805690	parcel of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.
805950	812730	Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives
812730	817690	on this as we can. I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got a sense from you of the
817690	823430	of the anger there is and the sadness too. No, there is no anger. We are fighting for our
823430	830450	lives. There is no anger. Let it be clear. You said that this is like Israel's 9-11.
831430	834410	Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?
835330	839570	It's not just because of this shock. It's because of the same modus operandi.
839970	846290	This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us at the
846290	852490	moment. Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that must defend its citizens
852490	859590	from terror. You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand what Israelis are
859590	868170	feeling. There is no both sides. When a terror organization ravages civilian areas, enters under
868170	875190	the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians, breaking barriers, that there is a fence. There has not
875190	880050	been any occupation of Gaza since 2005. And the voices that you are listening to...
880050	881750	There has been a blockade though, hasn't there, of Gaza?
881890	887990	No, no, there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every
887990	894910	day to work in Israel. There are thousands of truckloads. There is electricity and water still being supplied,
894910	902030	although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza because that's who was elected to reign over
902030	907470	Gaza. And there is a responsibility of the international community and of all those that cherish life and
907470	914610	liberty to hold Hamas to account for holding those two million civilians in Gaza hostage to their war
914610	917790	crimes, not only on Israel, but on Gaza's civilians.
917990	922690	How do you think the Israeli military should respond then? We've seen, we're told, more than 500
922690	927670	air strikes over the weekend. How do you think the Israeli military should... How do you think any
927670	929950	other countries should respond? Well, my job is to ask questions, not answer them.
930390	934590	Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect its civilians when they're
934590	940730	being attacked, including as we speak, in their homes, including as we speak. There is an ongoing
940730	947030	war here with genocidal terror. This is not two countries fighting each other. A genocidal
947030	954230	terror organization, ISIS, if you will, 9-11, needs moral clarity. And this is not just about Jews
954230	958250	around the world who are now under attack. So to my question, how do you think the military
958250	964210	should respond? There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza, although we're told
964210	971910	there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment. Do you think a ground invasion is
971910	978810	the way for the Israeli government to go? There are dozens of Israeli hostages and many of them are
978810	985390	civilians that were abducted, many of them raped, many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and
985390	993510	celebrated. And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect, as it must, the
993510	1001530	citizens of the State of Israel under attack as we speak. And every country that cherishes life and
1001530	1010410	liberty must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught massacre of its civilians. And those
1010410	1014570	hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization. And I want to make
1014570	1020530	it very clear, alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers and two civilians that have been held by the same
1020530	1026510	genocidal terror organization in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.
1026850	1032110	And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries must call for the immediate and
1032110	1039290	unconditional return because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror
1039290	1045950	organization to hold those civilians hostage as we speak. And what the IDF will have to do and the
1045950	1050710	State of Israel will have to do in its existential war is not just about the State of Israel. I want
1050710	1052310	to make it very clear to your listeners.
1052570	1055550	Michal, Kakla, Wunsch, we've got to leave it there. Thanks for joining us.
1056270	1061670	Well, staying with this story and looking at the business side of things, one industry that's already
1061670	1067150	feeling the impact of this conflict is the aviation industry with dozens of flights
1067150	1072070	already cancelled. Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore,
1072210	1074410	Katie Silva. Katie, what are we seeing?
1075690	1079710	Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines cancelling flights, the likes, for example,
1079930	1084850	of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair all cancelled journeys.
1085250	1090210	British Airways, for its part, told the BBC that it's only cancelled one flight on Sunday
1090210	1094290	and that it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days. And that's
1094290	1099190	unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport or if perhaps they want to land
1099190	1103950	at different times of the day that may be deemed safer. Many of these airlines are also offering
1104410	1109530	passengers to cancel their flights or to move the dates with no sort of change fees.
1110310	1115090	Flights to Israel's second international airport, Iliat, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea,
1115170	1120090	they've been unaffected. But we've also heard that Israeli's flag carrier, El Al, it's said that it's
1120090	1124790	going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now, but again, allowing airlines and
1124790	1127490	passengers to change their flights.
1127910	1133710	But Katie, this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying or desperately trying to leave.
1134670	1138910	Oh, to leave as well as to get home. So that's one of the major issues is that
1138910	1142450	many have found themselves stranded and with fears about whether or not
1142450	1148270	the airspace will be closed. So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there
1148270	1152570	amongst them, stranded in Cyprus at Lanika International Airport late last night.
1153350	1157550	Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights home.
1157910	1161850	As I say, rumours about whether or not the country may close its airspace.
1162090	1166170	It was hard to get tickets, we understand. Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example,
1166290	1171090	for no shows on the fully booked flights. And getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.
1171090	1175210	In terms of leaving the country, we've heard, for example, as well, from Athens,
1175450	1180670	the foreign ministry saying that it's working to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.
1181110	1187070	Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece. But there is indeed much concern
1187070	1191890	about many of the foreign workers in Israel. I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000
1191890	1196370	workers in Israel. And so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens
1196370	1198130	home if indeed they want to leave Israel.
1198590	1203090	All right, Katie Silva. Always a pleasure to have you on the program, our business correspondent
1203090	1208130	there in Singapore. And we are remaining with this story and we are now going to speak to
1208130	1213930	our international editor, Jeremy Bowen. Good morning to you, Jeremy. Now, you have called this
1213930	1218750	a major Middle East crisis. Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?
1219550	1229270	Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas has been able to break out of Gaza,
1229490	1235290	which is surrounded by, if you like, a ring of steel, of fences, wire fences and concrete,
1235850	1242610	break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis, including many, many civilians.
1242610	1247450	That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before.
1247950	1256110	And it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma. And plenty of people here compare it to
1256110	1262110	the 9-11 attacks in the United States. There's even one article in one of the newspapers here
1262110	1266690	saying that if you adjust the death toll for population, it's the equivalent of the Americans
1266690	1275210	losing more than 20,000 on 9-11. So it's a big, big event. And the Israeli response,
1275350	1280050	which is going to be, is already very heavy military action, but I think there'll be
1280830	1287210	a land invasion, too, of Gaza. Now, that also is something that could have reverberations right
1287210	1292090	across the region. So we're into really unexplored territory right now.
1292090	1298650	And, Jeremy, you have been in the region, you have been in the area. Just for our listeners' benefit,
1298830	1303610	can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like and how that area is to Israel?
1306030	1314890	Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast, which is surrounded mostly by Israel,
1315870	1321490	but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.
1323570	1328870	The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.
1329130	1335170	Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes when Israel was created
1335170	1340690	in 1948, a time that the Palestinians call the Nakba, the catastrophe.
1341510	1348730	And it's an area where people are mostly very poor. They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.
1348870	1355670	They're mostly not allowed to leave the area. There are plenty of adults there who've never left.
1356130	1363990	And so it's some... it is a situation which is... life there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic.
1363990	1369890	And since 2007, it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas,
1370030	1373630	which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic resistance movement.
1373930	1380730	And you wrote a nice read on our website where you said that, you know, Hamas blindsided Israel
1380730	1384330	with what you call most a serious attack in a generation.
1384330	1389930	And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken, including civilians as well as soldiers.
1389930	1395770	What sort of challenge does this pose for the government of Mr. Netanyahu and the army going forward?
1396730	1401710	It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government has, I think, faced probably
1401710	1411450	for 50 years since the 1973 Middle East war. He is... his political enemies are already blaming him,
1411630	1418110	saying that he took his eye off the ball for a variety of reasons. It's clear that there's been,
1418250	1423910	from the Israeli perspective, a huge intelligence failure. And they're struggling militarily to assert
1423910	1429610	themselves. They will succeed in doing that, I'm pretty certain, because Israel has got very powerful
1429610	1438850	armed forces. I think the big question, which was, and this is probably an equal challenge for the
1438850	1447390	Israelis, is what happens after that? How do they... what happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?
1447390	1453730	Because the Israelis, who used to occupy Gaza, and finally pulled out in 2005,
1455370	1459650	do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation. But if they sent in their troops,
1460130	1465530	they're going to... there's going to have to be some kind of governance of a territory, which is maybe
1465530	1470630	small, but as I said, contains getting on for two and a half million people.
1470890	1476070	Mm. Jeremy Bowen there. Thank you for coming on the program. He is our international editor.
1483110	1486430	We're going to move away from our top story. We will return to it later on in the program,
1486590	1489110	though. Isaac Fannin is here. He's going to give us some sports headlines.
1489330	1493770	Yeah, took Arsenal 12 goes, but they finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League.
1493910	1498330	Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th minute as City lost their second game
1498330	1502490	in the Premier League in a row for the first time that's happened in five years.
1503050	1507490	European football's governing body UEFA has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel
1507490	1512110	during the next fortnight amid increased tensions in the region. Israel were due to play
1512110	1517790	Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv, but that game has been rescheduled.
1517930	1522890	And UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days to see whether Israel's away
1522890	1527270	qualifier in Kosovo will still take place on the 15th of October.
1527270	1533550	To athletics news next, Kenyon Kelvin Kipton shattered the men's marathon world record in Chicago.
1533830	1538670	He beat his compatriot Eli Kipchoge's previous mark by more than 30 seconds.
1539290	1543110	A 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours, 35 seconds.
1543530	1551010	And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal in the final pool stage match.
1551010	1557530	Fiji got a losing bonus point and they qualify at Australia's expense due to their 22-15 victory
1557530	1559190	way back in September.
1559630	1561010	Isaac, thank you very much indeed.
1561670	1568390	Now, we are going to turn to Afghanistan because thousands of people in the west of the country
1568390	1575190	are spending a second night in the open after a strong earthquake on Saturday reduced entire villages to rubble.
1575190	1580970	There's been confusion about the number of dead with Taliban officials apologizing for an early assessment
1580970	1588170	that more than 2,000 people had died. The United Nations Humanitarian Agency says that more than 1,000
1588170	1594770	have been killed and more than 500 are still missing. I'm now joined by my colleague from the Afghan
1594770	1600490	service, Angela Gehr. Good morning to you, Angela. What is the latest that you can tell us about this
1600490	1613210	devastating event? Good morning. The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is actually I can say that is a very,
1613330	1628590	very, very big... The darkest time that we are experiencing in Afghanistan, the number that the Taliban are trying to
1629610	1635990	share with you share with the media is very different from what we have receiving from the people.
1636350	1646410	I think in that area, we had more than 20 villages which are completely destroyed
1648070	1656790	in the earthquake. And also, there is no way for the... Actually, in the first half,
1656790	1663050	where the Taliban tried to control the media, we didn't receive the... Actually, we thought that everything
1663050	1678190	is not that bad what we... When we sent the volunteers group to the area and they... Actually, I'm so sorry.
1678450	1684210	I'm very... No, don't worry. And so, Angela, basically, the Taliban have gone back to what they said,
1684210	1689230	the numbers have changed. But what are people saying on the ground, those who've been affected?
1690530	1701290	They don't accept the numbers which the Taliban is sharing, actually. And also, I think more than
1701290	1712190	2,000 people are killed, 1,000 people displaced, and 1,000 people are missing in this crisis.
1712190	1722990	And we have nothing at that moment. At this moment, there are no big, big offer or support from
1723390	1733850	from the Taliban for the people. Just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help for the people,
1733850	1740410	and the volunteers group from... Angela, thank you so much for coming on to the program,
1740630	1745810	telling us about the devastating earthquake that has shaken Afghanistan in the west of the country.
