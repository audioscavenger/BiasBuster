60700	65460	And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000
65460	65920	people.

91650	95850	Israel two days after they carried out their devastating mass assault.

317470	321390	The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were
321390	322350	found dead in prison.
323650	327290	A hoard of coins believed to have belonged to a Highland clan chief, who was

369610	370810	BBC News.
374510	375690	Thank you for that bulletin of news.
376050	379990	Hello, your Newsday from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wohonda and Rob Young.
380050	383070	Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue to focus on the conflict
383070	388030	between Israel and Gaza with voices from both sides and we'll get all your
388030	390370	sports and business headlines too.
394270	398930	We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the
398930	402290	numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.
402810	406810	The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks
406810	409530	overall, with more than 2000 injured.
409690	415170	The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival
415170	419730	attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.
419730	424590	The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as
424590	427910	the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.
428450	432370	In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least
432370	437750	400 people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2000 wounded, according to
437750	440430	the latest update from the Palestinian officials.
441010	444430	Video images show many buildings being blown up in large scale
444430	447550	destruction, shops are closed, the streets are empty.
447550	451070	The city is said to be like a ghost town.
451470	456270	According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have now been
456270	460530	displaced in Gaza because of the airstrikes and many Palestinians say
460530	463090	they are now living in fear of their lives.
463250	466570	In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.
467310	472330	The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent
472330	478590	and a huge Gaza is very highly dense populated area with very limited
478590	486170	geographical area like with over two million people living in 360
486170	490910	kilometers square, which make it each and every missile dropped very
490910	492610	impactful and damaging.
493490	498290	The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context
498290	504290	of the Israeli ongoing decades long military occupation and settler
504290	509950	colonization of Palestinian land and the imposition of a system of
509950	514690	oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.
514910	521270	Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17
521270	530210	years against the Palestinians, refusing its population access to
530210	536390	basic supplies and material needs to survive and trapping them in
536390	543450	amounts to an open air prison with restrictions on right to movement,
543670	547350	right to health and many other associated basic rights.
547630	550710	Yet we were told as civilians to leave.
550710	555310	I mean, leave and go where no crossings are open.
555590	559710	Neither the sea that is also have restriction to some point.
560430	562590	If you trespass, you can you can be shot.
562810	566910	For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed,
567150	571350	including women, children, elderly and persons with disabilities.
571590	575970	I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school
575970	582590	that not even fully prepared or accommodate these numbers and
582590	584630	provide for their needs.
585570	589210	I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws
589210	591550	and conflicts and its principles.
591710	596170	These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between
596170	605490	competence and civilians, avoid disproportionate use of force and
605490	612110	have have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies for the for
612110	612970	the population.
613830	621910	And now there is there is limited electricity and and and
621910	625950	crossings are fully closed to let in any supplies.
626310	630790	But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles.
630930	635390	And the international community has to play a role in ending this
635390	638110	bloodshed and killing of civilians.
639090	642830	Our resident in Gaza, they are about what the last couple of days
642830	643790	have been like.
643850	646790	And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to
646790	648950	BBC.com for a slash news.
649070	652490	There is a live page of being updated as we get more news.
652790	655710	Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the
655710	658770	country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism,
659050	662090	a former member of the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament,
662270	663210	Mikhal Kotler-Vunch.
663330	664590	Thanks so much for joining us.
665390	669330	How is so much for how are Israelis feeling today?
671030	675610	You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how
675610	679990	Israelis are feeling is it actually encourages me to ask
679990	684170	you the question, because, you know, when I hear the framing
684170	688010	of what is happening in Israel, where a genocidal terror
688010	692090	organization holding two million civilians in Gaza
692090	696530	alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on
696530	700930	Saturday morning, as we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath
700930	705130	morning and a holiday in Israel, five thousand rockets
705130	709090	launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas
709090	713070	in Gaza, each rocket, a double war crime and a violation
713070	714750	of international humanitarian law.
715030	718510	When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that
718510	724710	indiscriminately shot 260, at least, young party goers
724710	728110	on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the
728110	733280	anti-Semitic terror organization, Hamas, actually
733470	737230	designated as a terror organization, funded and supported
737230	741590	by a genocidal regime in Iran, holding its own
743130	747230	civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza,
747230	749990	in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11
749990	753950	was a wake-up call to the West, that genocidal terror
753950	757190	cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign
757190	759810	democratic countries conduct ourselves.
759990	762530	So I would turn the question to you, if this were
762530	765430	happening anywhere else in the world, not only for
765430	769290	Israel's right to defend its civilians, but Israel's
769290	772430	indeed responsibility to defend its civilians, where
772430	776950	the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours
776950	785050	are indeed civilians in holding families of Holocaust
785050	788210	survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip,
788450	792170	of entire families being butchered in their homes.
793130	796750	And to hear the way that the framing that BBC
796750	800470	enables this situation is actually part and parcel
800470	804630	of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue
804630	805830	to dictate the discourse.
805950	808130	Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to
808130	812910	as many different people with as many perspectives
812910	813830	on this as we can.
814030	816630	I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got
816630	820190	a sense from you of the anger there is,
820270	821610	and the sadness, too.
821610	822430	No, there is no anger.
822550	823930	We are fighting for our lives.
824110	825050	There is no anger.
825230	826250	Let it be clear.
826770	830710	You said that this is like Israel's 9-11.
831390	834610	Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?
835630	837210	It's not just because of this shock.
837390	839790	It's because of the same modus operandi.
840330	844370	This is a terror organization listed as such in most
844370	846810	of the countries that are listening to us at the moment.
847470	850550	Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign
850550	853690	country that must defend its citizens from terror.
853690	857830	You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want
857830	860110	to understand what Israelis are feeling.
860410	861830	There is no both sides.
862050	866830	When a terror organization ravages civilian areas,
867690	869970	enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets
869970	873330	targeting those civilians, breaking barriers,
873710	874670	that there is a fence.
874710	878730	There has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.
879270	880570	And the voices that you are listening to in Gaza...
880570	881090	There has been a blockade, though,
881150	881890	hasn't there, of Gaza?
881890	885110	No, there is no blockade because there are thousands,
885470	888730	thousands of workers entering Gaza every day
888730	889730	to work in Israel.
890290	892350	There are thousands of truckloads.
892510	894990	There is electricity and water still being supplied,
894990	897150	although Hamas has responsibility
897150	898850	for the civilians in Gaza,
898870	902670	because that's who was elected to reign over Gaza.
902830	904070	And there is a responsibility
904070	905770	of the international community
905770	907870	and of all those that cherish life and liberty
907870	909550	to hold Hamas to account
909550	913030	for holding those 2 million civilians in Gaza
913030	915050	hostage to their war crimes,
915290	917910	not only on Israel, but on Gaza's civilians.
917990	920270	How do you think the Israeli military should respond then?
920410	921750	We've seen, we're told,
921770	925450	more than 500 airstrikes over the weekend.
925670	926850	How do you think the Israeli military should,
926850	928030	how do you think any other country
928030	930050	Well, my job is to ask questions, not answer them.
930670	932970	Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do
932970	934290	in order to protect its civilians
934290	935190	when they're being attacked,
935450	938410	including as we speak, in their homes,
938410	939950	including as we speak.
940110	943250	There is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror.
943590	946310	This is not two countries fighting each other.
946590	949170	A genocidal terror organization, ISIS, if you will,
949530	952270	9-11, needs moral clarity.
952490	955230	And this is not just about Jews around the world
955230	956390	who are now under attack.
956390	957170	So to my question,
957290	958910	how do you think the military should respond?
958970	962070	There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion
962070	965370	of Gaza, although we're told there are dozens
965930	970090	of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment.
970290	972230	Do you think a ground invasion is the way
972230	974130	for the Israeli government to go?
974990	977870	There are dozens of Israeli hostages
977870	980690	and many of them are civilians that were abducted,
981170	982010	many of them raped,
982510	985210	many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza
985210	986310	and celebrated.
986990	990410	And the Israeli IDF will do everything
990410	993150	that it needs to do to protect, as it must,
993150	995870	the citizens of the State of Israel under attack
995870	996870	as we speak.
997790	1002150	And every country that cherishes life and liberty
1002150	1007230	must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught,
1007890	1009650	massacre of its civilians.
1009910	1011670	And those hostages that have been held
1011670	1014010	are being held by a genocidal terror organization.
1014010	1015610	And I wanna make it very clear,
1015830	1018290	alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers
1018290	1020010	and two civilians that have been held
1020010	1022170	by the same genocidal terror organization
1022170	1024830	in a nine-year standing violation
1024830	1026630	of international law and human rights.
1027210	1028690	And each one of those civilians
1028690	1030450	and every one of our countries
1030450	1033350	must call for the immediate and unconditional return
1033350	1036470	because it is countries supporting Gaza
1036470	1040110	and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization,
1040410	1043610	to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.
1044050	1045730	And what IDF will have to do
1045730	1047290	and the State of Israel will have to do
1047290	1048690	in its existential war
1048690	1050490	is not just about the State of Israel.
1050490	1052450	I wanna make it very clear to your listeners.
1053090	1054750	Michal Kotler-Vunch, we gotta leave it there.
1054790	1055970	Thanks for joining us.
1056710	1057830	Well, same with this story
1057830	1060330	and looking at the business side of things.
1060490	1063430	One industry that's already feeling the impact
1063430	1066050	of this conflict is the aviation industry
1066050	1068330	with dozens of flights already canceled.
1068750	1071330	Let's get the details with our business correspondent
1071330	1073010	in Singapore, Katie Silva.
1073150	1074550	Katie, what are we seeing?
1076030	1077110	Well, yeah, as you mentioned,
1077270	1078950	many airlines canceling flights.
1078950	1081810	The likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France,
1081970	1084970	Lufthansa, Emirates, and Ryanair all cancel journeys.
1085470	1087390	British Airways, for its part, told the BBC
1087390	1090290	that it's only canceled one flight on Sunday
1090290	1092830	and that it's going to be adjusting departure times
1092830	1094050	for flights in the coming days.
1094090	1095550	And that's unclear if that's because
1095550	1097170	of disruption at the airport
1097170	1099290	or if perhaps they want to land
1099290	1101570	at different times of the day that may be deemed safer.
1102130	1104950	Many of these airlines are also offering passengers
1104950	1107610	to cancel their flights or to move the dates
1107610	1109850	with no sort of change fees.
1110650	1112930	Flights to Israel's second international airport,
1113190	1115150	Eliat, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea,
1115150	1116370	they've been unaffected.
1116490	1119230	But we've also heard that Israeli's flag carrier, El Al,
1119610	1121530	it's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights
1121530	1123190	to Tel Aviv for now, but again,
1123310	1127610	allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.
1128070	1129790	But Katie, this also comes at the same time
1129790	1131650	as many Israelis are trying
1131650	1133770	or desperately trying to leave.
1135090	1137470	To leave, well, as well as to get home.
1137470	1138650	So that's one of the major issues
1138650	1140550	is that many have found themselves stranded
1140550	1142970	and with fears about whether or not
1144190	1145790	the airspace will be closed.
1146230	1147530	So one of our reporters, for example,
1147530	1149310	was actually there amongst them,
1149390	1150410	stranded in Cyprus,
1150610	1153050	at Lanica International Airport late last night.
1153710	1154730	Hundreds were packing in,
1154790	1155990	hundreds of Israelis hoping
1155990	1157690	to get one of the last flights home.
1158010	1160230	As I say, rumors about whether or not
1160230	1161990	the country may close its airspace.
1162390	1164050	It was hard to get tickets, we understand.
1164210	1165770	Dozens were waiting to get the seats,
1165770	1168270	for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights.
1168870	1169910	And getting back into the country
1169910	1171250	certainly hasn't been easy.
1171610	1172870	In terms of leaving the country,
1173010	1175350	we've heard, for example, as well from Athens,
1175450	1176890	the foreign ministry saying that it's working
1176890	1180830	to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.
1181450	1182670	Some of them were due to arrive
1182670	1184730	back late last night into Greece.
1184770	1187150	But there is indeed much concern
1187150	1189750	about many of the foreign workers in Israel.
1189950	1192850	I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers
1192850	1195010	in Israel and so governments around the world
1195010	1196690	are looking at how they can get their citizens home
1196690	1198330	if, indeed, they want to leave Israel.
1199010	1200070	All right, Katie Silva,
1200250	1201950	always a pleasure to have you on the program,
1202070	1204450	our business correspondent there in Singapore.
1204750	1206970	And we are remaining with this story
1206970	1207970	and we are now going to speak
1207970	1211070	to our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
1211130	1212390	Good morning to you, Jeremy.
1212490	1216650	Now, you have called this a major Middle East crisis.
1216810	1218890	Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?
1220290	1222090	Well, it's unprecedented
1222090	1226630	that the Palestinian armed group Hamas
1226630	1229370	has been able to break out of Gaza,
1229530	1231950	which is surrounded by, if you like,
1232050	1235470	a ring of steel, of fences, wire fences and concrete,
1236150	1240930	break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis,
1241050	1242890	including many, many civilians.
1243450	1245490	That kind of thing is something
1245490	1247730	that Israel hasn't experienced before
1247730	1253210	and it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma
1253210	1256110	and plenty of people here compare it
1256110	1258790	to the 9-11 attacks in the United States.
1259250	1262230	There's even one article in one of the newspapers here
1262230	1264990	saying that if you adjust the death toll for population,
1265510	1266770	it's equivalent to the Americans
1266770	1269710	losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.
1269850	1273470	So it's a big, big event
1273470	1276310	and the Israeli response, which is going to be,
1276310	1279070	is already very heavy military action,
1279370	1282690	but they think there'll be a land invasion, too, of Gaza.
1283390	1285250	Now, that also is something
1285250	1288510	that could have reverberations right across the region.
1288870	1292310	So we're into really unexplored territory right now.
1293590	1295530	And, Jeremy, you have been in the region,
1295550	1296790	you have been in the area.
1296890	1298790	Just for our listeners' benefit,
1298850	1301370	can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like
1301370	1303770	and how that area is to Israel?
1305770	1312170	Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast,
1312610	1315290	which is surrounded mostly by Israel,
1316610	1321750	but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.
1323650	1326170	The Palestinian population of Gaza
1326170	1329130	is around 2.4 million people,
1329490	1332770	many of them are descendants of families
1332770	1337110	who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948,
1337510	1339750	a time that the Palestinians call the Nakba,
1340090	1340950	the catastrophe.
1342150	1345370	And it's an area where people are mostly very poor.
1345510	1348930	They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.
1349270	1351870	They're mostly not allowed to leave the area.
1352330	1355850	There are plenty of adults there who've never left.
1357030	1359810	And so it is a situation
1359810	1362790	which is life there is very hard
1362790	1364230	and it's highly nationalistic.
1364470	1367310	And since 2007, it's been controlled
1367310	1369970	by the Palestinian militant group, Hamas,
1370090	1371990	which is an Arabic acronym
1371990	1373730	for the Islamic resistance movement.
1374230	1377930	And you wrote a nice read on our website
1377930	1380930	where you said that Hamas blindsided Israel
1380930	1383530	with what you call the most serious attack
1383530	1384510	in a generation.
1384770	1386930	And we're hearing stories of hostages
1386930	1387870	that have been taken,
1387870	1390170	including civilians as well as soldiers.
1390590	1392650	What sort of challenge does this pose
1392650	1394490	for the government of Mr. Netanyahu
1394490	1395950	and the army going forward?
1397030	1398650	It's the most profound challenge
1398650	1400850	that any Israel government has, I think,
1401150	1403290	faced probably for 50 years
1403290	1405970	since the 1973 Middle East war.
1408490	1411570	His political enemies are already blaming him,
1411570	1414390	saying that he took his eye off the ball
1414390	1416230	for a variety of reasons.
1416870	1418210	It's clear that there's been,
1418230	1419390	from the Israeli perspective,
1419550	1421150	a huge intelligence failure
1421710	1423470	and they're struggling militarily
1423470	1424530	to assert themselves.
1424690	1426350	They will succeed in doing that.
1426610	1427750	I'm pretty certain
1427750	1430630	because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.
1431410	1434230	I think the big question, which was,
1434230	1438050	and this is probably an equal challenge
1438050	1442110	for the Israelis, is what happens after that?
1442450	1445690	How do they, what happens in Gaza
1445690	1447490	on the day that they leave?
1447750	1450530	Because the Israelis, who used to occupy Gaza
1450530	1454130	and finally pulled out in 2005,
1455410	1458290	do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation.
1458330	1459810	But if they send in their troops,
1460590	1462930	there's gonna have to be some kind of governance
1462930	1466070	of a territory which is maybe small,
1466090	1467030	but as I said,
1468150	1470790	contains getting on for two and a half million people.
1471890	1473130	Jeremy Bowen there,
1473130	1474490	thank you for coming on the program.
1474490	1476470	He is our international editor.
1483410	1484830	We're gonna move away from our top story.
1484910	1486830	We will return to it later on in the program though.
1487070	1487910	Isaac Fanon is here.
1487990	1489230	He's gonna give us some sports headlines.
1489350	1490750	Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goals,
1490810	1492890	but they finally beat Manchester City
1492890	1493870	in the Premier League.
1494070	1495550	Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal
1495550	1498430	in the 86th minute as City lost their second game
1498430	1500370	in the Premier League in a row.
1500530	1502630	It's the first time that's happened in five years.
1503290	1504950	European football's governing body, UEFA,
1505070	1507630	has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel
1507630	1509010	during the next fortnight,
1509090	1511090	amid increased tensions in the region.
1511090	1513010	Israel were due to play Switzerland
1513010	1516050	in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv,
1516150	1517890	but that game has been rescheduled
1517890	1520010	and UEFA said it will assess the situation
1520010	1521970	over the coming days to see whether
1521970	1524890	Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo
1524890	1527450	will still take place on the 15th of October.
1527930	1529270	To athletics news next,
1529570	1531070	Kenyan Kelvin Kipton shattered
1531070	1533690	the men's marathon world record in Chicago.
1533910	1536550	He beat his compatriot Elliot Kipchoge's
1536810	1538930	by more than 30 seconds.
1539310	1541550	The 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours,
1541950	1543290	35 seconds.
1543790	1546090	And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup,
1546150	1549230	despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal
1549230	1551090	in the final pool stage match.
1551330	1552910	Fiji got a losing bonus point
1552910	1555250	and they qualify at Australia's expense
1555250	1559250	due to their 22-15 victory way back in September.
1560010	1561250	Isaac, thank you very much indeed.
1562190	1565530	Now we are going to turn to Afghanistan
1565530	1568570	because thousands of people in the west of the country
1568570	1571010	are spending a second night in the open
1571010	1573090	after a strong earthquake on Saturday
1573090	1575490	reduced entire villages to rubble.
1575750	1577790	There's been confusion about the number of dead
1577790	1579830	with Taliban officials apologizing
1579830	1581110	for an early assessment
1581110	1584010	that more than 2,000 people had died.
1584210	1586310	The United Nations humanitarian agency
1586310	1589210	says that more than 1,000 have been killed
1589210	1591510	and more than 500 are still missing.
1591910	1593950	I'm now joined by my colleague
1593950	1596350	from the Afghan service, Angela Gehr.
1596490	1597930	Good morning to you, Angela.
1598210	1600050	What is the latest that you can tell us
1600050	1601790	about this devastating event?
1603010	1604370	Good morning.
1605790	1609690	The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is,
1610890	1614590	actually I can say that is a very, very, very big,
1619870	1623770	the darkest time that we are experiencing
1623770	1628330	in Afghanistan, the number that the Taliban are trying
1628330	1632390	to share with the media is very different
1632390	1636290	what we have receiving from the people.
1637050	1644130	I think in that area we had more than 20 violets
1644130	1651050	which are completely destroyed in the earthquake.
1651390	1655330	And also there is no way for the,
1655570	1657490	actually in the first half of the Taliban
1657490	1659270	tried to control the medias.
1659770	1661350	We didn't receive that.
1661350	1665430	Actually we felt that everything is not that bad
1667690	1675070	what we sent the volunteers group to the area.
1675970	1678310	And actually I'm so sorry.
1678670	1679310	I'm very-
1679310	1679990	No, don't worry.
1679990	1683670	And so Angela, basically the Taliban have gone back
1683670	1685410	to what they said, the numbers have changed
1685410	1688090	but what are people saying on the ground,
1688190	1689450	those who've been affected?
1691250	1694470	They don't accept the numbers
1694470	1696470	which the Taliban is shedding.
1697450	1702490	Actually, and also I think more than 2000 people
1702490	1706250	are killed, 1000 people displaced
1706250	1711730	and 1000 people are missing in this crisis.
1713270	1716930	And we have nothing at that moment.
1717270	1722750	At this moment there are no big offer or support
1722750	1725750	from the Taliban for the people.
1726950	1733190	Just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help
1733190	1736850	for the people and the volunteers group from-
1736850	1737270	Angela.
1737290	1738410	In other cities.
1738590	1740510	Thank you so much for coming onto the program
1740510	1743110	telling us about the devastating earthquake
1743110	1745890	that has shaken Afghanistan in the worst of the country.
