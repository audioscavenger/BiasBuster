00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,500
This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,660
more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza.

3
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,560
Today, we hear from a woman in Gaza.

4
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,860
In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival, the first

5
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,460
site attacked by Hamas.

6
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,660
We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that

7
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,440
has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.

8
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,460
And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000

9
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:05,920
people.

10
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,660
Rescue efforts are continuing.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,020
But first, we're getting a bulletin of World News.

12
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,770
This is Danielle Yawowiecki with the BBC News.

13
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,210
Hello.

14
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,130
The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over

15
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,050
500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

16
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,650
Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside

17
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,850
Israel two days after they carried out their devastating mass assault.

18
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,590
More than 700 Israelis have been killed.

19
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,390
John Donison is in Jerusalem.

20
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,110
The Israeli military says it has continued to target Hamas infrastructure with airstrikes

21
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,630
overnight.

22
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,670
The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced, with many

23
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,710
seeking shelter in UN schools.

24
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,450
But most believe this is just the beginning.

25
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,190
Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000

26
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,450
army reservists.

27
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,130
Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion, with Israel saying

28
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,390
its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

29
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,370
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far

30
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,030
by Israeli airstrikes.

31
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,030
Over 2,000 people have been injured.

32
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,190
They said power cuts were widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical

33
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,730
workers.

34
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,210
Hamas said it had fired a new barrage of missiles into Israel.

35
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,710
Three US air carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended

36
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,070
flights to Tel Aviv.

37
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,870
The United States says it's sending immediate extra munitions to Israel.

38
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,410
The Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier,

39
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,790
to the eastern Mediterranean.

40
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,730
More from Barbara Plattusher in Washington.

41
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,450
The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel

42
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,950
and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.

43
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,430
They're sending an aircraft carrier with a deck of warplanes, accompanied by cruisers

44
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,410
and destroyers.

45
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,290
Also extra military assistance, such as munitions.

46
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,850
In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining

47
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,350
the fight.

48
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,030
It's backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas.

49
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,470
There are reports that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack, although the Secretary

50
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,690
of State Antony Blinken said the US hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.

51
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,350
The UN Security Council has held an emergency closed-door session to discuss the crisis.

52
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,530
The UN Middle East envoy called on countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore

53
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:35,990
calm.

54
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,330
More from Neda Taufiq in New York.

55
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,930
Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement.

56
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,290
Not all, but many, condemned Hamas.

57
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,810
The UAE's ambassador to the UN, Lanin Acebe, told reporters there was real concern

58
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,570
that tensions in the region could become inflamed.

59
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,610
Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, showed graphic pictures

60
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,910
of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.

61
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,590
The Palestinian UN ambassador, Riyad Mansour, told reporters he'd requested an emergency

62
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,010
meeting of Arab League states in Cairo.

63
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,730
BBC World News.

64
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,930
An independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into allegations that British

65
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,030
special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians, including children, in Afghanistan.

66
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,230
The inquiry was set up by the British government after legal action was brought by two Afghan

67
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,850
families.

68
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,750
The US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,210
China, has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

70
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,810
Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit, as Washington seeks

71
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,370
to ease tensions with Beijing.

72
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,950
Regional elections in two of Germany's largest and wealthiest states, Bavaria and Hesse,

73
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,330
have dealt a blow to the parties that form the centre-left federal government.

74
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,090
Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberal

75
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,990
Free Democrats.

76
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,230
The Christian Democrats again emerge as the largest party.

77
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,090
The president of Ecuador has extended the state of emergency by 30 days.

78
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,710
It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential

79
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,170
candidate Fernando Villavicencio.

80
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,390
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were

81
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,350
found dead in prison.

82
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,290
A hoard of coins believed to have belonged to a Highland clan chief, who was

83
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,330
murdered more than 300 years ago, has been found in Scotland.

84
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,450
Alexandra McKenzie reports.

85
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:38,170
The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the first major excavation

86
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,270
in Glencoe.

87
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,150
The dig focused on scattered rocks believed to have been the McDonald clan chief's

88
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,630
summer house.

89
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,710
More than 300 years after he died in the Glencoe massacre, an archaeology

90
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,330
student taking part in her first ever dig found the hoard.

91
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,230
The University of Glasgow said the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins.

92
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,130
A number of other artifacts were also discovered at the site, including a musket

93
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,730
and fouling shot, pottery from across Europe and a powder major.

BBC News.

95
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,690
Thank you for that bulletin of news.

96
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,990
Hello, your Newsday from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wohonda and Rob Young.

97
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,070
Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue to focus on the conflict

98
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,030
between Israel and Gaza with voices from both sides and we'll get all your

99
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,370
sports and business headlines too.

100
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,930
We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the

101
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,290
numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.

102
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,810
The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks

103
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,530
overall, with more than 2000 injured.

104
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:55,170
The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival

105
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,730
attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.

106
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,590
The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as

107
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,910
the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.

108
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,370
In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least

109
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,750
400 people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2000 wounded, according to

110
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,430
the latest update from the Palestinian officials.

111
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,430
Video images show many buildings being blown up in large scale

112
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,550
destruction, shops are closed, the streets are empty.

113
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,070
The city is said to be like a ghost town.

114
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,270
According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have now been

115
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,530
displaced in Gaza because of the airstrikes and many Palestinians say

116
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,090
they are now living in fear of their lives.

117
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,570
In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.

118
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,330
The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent

119
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:58,590
and a huge Gaza is very highly dense populated area with very limited

120
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:06,170
geographical area like with over two million people living in 360

121
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,910
kilometers square, which make it each and every missile dropped very

122
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,610
impactful and damaging.

123
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,290
The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context

124
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:24,290
of the Israeli ongoing decades long military occupation and settler

125
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,950
colonization of Palestinian land and the imposition of a system of

126
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,690
oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.

127
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:41,270
Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17

128
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:50,210
years against the Palestinians, refusing its population access to

129
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:56,390
basic supplies and material needs to survive and trapping them in

130
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:03,450
amounts to an open air prison with restrictions on right to movement,

131
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,350
right to health and many other associated basic rights.

132
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,710
Yet we were told as civilians to leave.

133
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,310
I mean, leave and go where no crossings are open.

134
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,710
Neither the sea that is also have restriction to some point.

135
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,590
If you trespass, you can you can be shot.

136
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,910
For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed,

137
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,350
including women, children, elderly and persons with disabilities.

138
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,970
I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school

139
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:42,590
that not even fully prepared or accommodate these numbers and

140
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,630
provide for their needs.

141
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,210
I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws

142
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,550
and conflicts and its principles.

143
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,170
These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between

144
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:05,490
competence and civilians, avoid disproportionate use of force and

145
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,110
have have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies for the for

146
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,970
the population.

147
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:21,910
And now there is there is limited electricity and and and

148
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,950
crossings are fully closed to let in any supplies.

149
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,790
But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles.

150
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,390
And the international community has to play a role in ending this

151
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,110
bloodshed and killing of civilians.

152
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,830
Our resident in Gaza, they are about what the last couple of days

153
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,790
have been like.

154
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,790

There is a live page of being updated as we get more news.

157
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,710
Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the

158
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,770
country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism,

159
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,090
a former member of the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament,

160
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,210
Mikhal Kotler-Vunch.

161
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,590
Thanks so much for joining us.

162
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,330
How is so much for how are Israelis feeling today?

163
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,610
You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how

164
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,990
Israelis are feeling is it actually encourages me to ask

165
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,170
you the question, because, you know, when I hear the framing

166
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,010
of what is happening in Israel, where a genocidal terror

167
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,090
organization holding two million civilians in Gaza

168
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,530
alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on

169
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,930
Saturday morning, as we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath

170
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,130
morning and a holiday in Israel, five thousand rockets

171
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,090
launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas

172
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,070
in Gaza, each rocket, a double war crime and a violation

173
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,750
of international humanitarian law.

174
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,510
When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that

175
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:04,710
indiscriminately shot 260, at least, young party goers

176
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,110
on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the

177
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,280
anti-Semitic terror organization, Hamas, actually

178
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,230
designated as a terror organization, funded and supported

179
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,590
by a genocidal regime in Iran, holding its own

180
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,230
civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza,

181
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,990
in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11

182
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,950
was a wake-up call to the West, that genocidal terror

183
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,190
cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign

184
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,810
democratic countries conduct ourselves.

185
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,530
So I would turn the question to you, if this were

186
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,430
happening anywhere else in the world, not only for

187
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,290
Israel's right to defend its civilians, but Israel's

188
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,430
indeed responsibility to defend its civilians, where

189
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,950
the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours

190
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:05,050
are indeed civilians in holding families of Holocaust

191
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,210
survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip,

192
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,170
of entire families being butchered in their homes.

193
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,750
And to hear the way that the framing that BBC

194
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,470
enables this situation is actually part and parcel

195
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,630
of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue

196
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,830
to dictate the discourse.

197
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,130
Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to

198
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,910
as many different people with as many perspectives

199
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,830
on this as we can.

200
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,630
I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got

201
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,190
a sense from you of the anger there is,

202
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,610
and the sadness, too.

203
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,430
No, there is no anger.

204
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,930
We are fighting for our lives.

205
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,050
There is no anger.

206
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,250
Let it be clear.

207
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,710
You said that this is like Israel's 9-11.

208
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,610
Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?

209
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,210
It's not just because of this shock.

210
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,790
It's because of the same modus operandi.

211
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:04,370
This is a terror organization listed as such in most

212
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,810
of the countries that are listening to us at the moment.

213
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,550
Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign

214
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,690
country that must defend its citizens from terror.

215
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,830
You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want

216
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,110
to understand what Israelis are feeling.

217
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,830
There is no both sides.

218
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,830
When a terror organization ravages civilian areas,

219
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,970
enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets

220
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,330
targeting those civilians, breaking barriers,

221
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,670
that there is a fence.

222
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,730
There has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.

223
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,570
And the voices that you are listening to in Gaza...

224
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,090
There has been a blockade, though,

225
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,890
hasn't there, of Gaza?

226
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,110
No, there is no blockade because there are thousands,

227
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,730
thousands of workers entering Gaza every day

228
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,730
to work in Israel.

229
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,350
There are thousands of truckloads.

230
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,990
There is electricity and water still being supplied,

231
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,150
although Hamas has responsibility

232
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,850
for the civilians in Gaza,

233
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,670
because that's who was elected to reign over Gaza.

234
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,070
And there is a responsibility

235
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,770
of the international community

236
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,870
and of all those that cherish life and liberty

237
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,550
to hold Hamas to account

238
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,030
for holding those 2 million civilians in Gaza

239
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,050
hostage to their war crimes,

240
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,910
not only on Israel, but on Gaza's civilians.

241
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,270
How do you think the Israeli military should respond then?

242
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,750
We've seen, we're told,

243
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,450
more than 500 airstrikes over the weekend.

244
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,850
How do you think the Israeli military should,

245
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,030
how do you think any other country

246
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,050
Well, my job is to ask questions, not answer them.

247
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,970
Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do

248
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,290
in order to protect its civilians

249
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,190
when they're being attacked,

250
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,410
including as we speak, in their homes,

251
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,950
including as we speak.

252
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,250
There is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror.

253
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,310
This is not two countries fighting each other.

254
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,170
A genocidal terror organization, ISIS, if you will,

255
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,270
9-11, needs moral clarity.

256
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,230
And this is not just about Jews around the world

257
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,390
who are now under attack.

258
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,170
So to my question,

259
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,910
how do you think the military should respond?

260
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,070
There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion

261
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,370
of Gaza, although we're told there are dozens

262
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,090
of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment.

263
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,230
Do you think a ground invasion is the way

264
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,130
for the Israeli government to go?

265
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,870
There are dozens of Israeli hostages

266
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,690
and many of them are civilians that were abducted,

267
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,010
many of them raped,

268
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,210
many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza

269
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,310
and celebrated.

270
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,410
And the Israeli IDF will do everything

271
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,150
that it needs to do to protect, as it must,

272
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,870
the citizens of the State of Israel under attack

273
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,870
as we speak.

274
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,150
And every country that cherishes life and liberty

275
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:47,230
must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught,

276
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,650
massacre of its civilians.

277
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,670
And those hostages that have been held

278
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,010
are being held by a genocidal terror organization.

279
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,610
And I wanna make it very clear,

280
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,290
alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers

281
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,010
and two civilians that have been held

282
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,170
by the same genocidal terror organization

283
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,830
in a nine-year standing violation

284
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,630
of international law and human rights.

285
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,690
And each one of those civilians

286
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,450
and every one of our countries

287
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,350
must call for the immediate and unconditional return

288
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,470
because it is countries supporting Gaza

289
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,110
and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization,

290
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,610
to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.

291
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,730
And what IDF will have to do

292
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,290
and the State of Israel will have to do

293
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,690
in its existential war

294
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,490
is not just about the State of Israel.

295
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,450
I wanna make it very clear to your listeners.

296
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,750
Michal Kotler-Vunch, we gotta leave it there.

297
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,970
Thanks for joining us.

298
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,830
Well, same with this story

299
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,330
and looking at the business side of things.

300
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,430
One industry that's already feeling the impact

301
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,050
of this conflict is the aviation industry

302
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,330
with dozens of flights already canceled.

303
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,330
Let's get the details with our business correspondent

304
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,010
in Singapore, Katie Silva.

305
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,550
Katie, what are we seeing?

306
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,110
Well, yeah, as you mentioned,

307
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,950
many airlines canceling flights.

308
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,810
The likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France,

309
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,970
Lufthansa, Emirates, and Ryanair all cancel journeys.

310
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,390
British Airways, for its part, told the BBC

311
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,290
that it's only canceled one flight on Sunday

312
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,830
and that it's going to be adjusting departure times

313
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,050
for flights in the coming days.

314
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,550
And that's unclear if that's because

315
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,170
of disruption at the airport

316
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,290
or if perhaps they want to land

317
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,570
at different times of the day that may be deemed safer.

318
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,950
Many of these airlines are also offering passengers

319
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,610
to cancel their flights or to move the dates

320
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,850
with no sort of change fees.

321
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,930
Flights to Israel's second international airport,

322
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,150
Eliat, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea,

323
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,370
they've been unaffected.

324
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,230
But we've also heard that Israeli's flag carrier, El Al,

325
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,530
it's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights

326
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,190
to Tel Aviv for now, but again,

327
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,610
allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.

328
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,790
But Katie, this also comes at the same time

329
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,650
as many Israelis are trying

330
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,770
or desperately trying to leave.

331
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,470
To leave, well, as well as to get home.

332
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,650
So that's one of the major issues

333
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,550
is that many have found themselves stranded

334
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,970
and with fears about whether or not

335
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,790
the airspace will be closed.

336
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,530
So one of our reporters, for example,

337
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,310
was actually there amongst them,

338
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,410
stranded in Cyprus,

339
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,050
at Lanica International Airport late last night.

340
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,730
Hundreds were packing in,

341
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,990
hundreds of Israelis hoping

342
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,690
to get one of the last flights home.

343
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,230
As I say, rumors about whether or not

344
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,990
the country may close its airspace.

345
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,050
It was hard to get tickets, we understand.

346
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,770
Dozens were waiting to get the seats,

347
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,270
for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights.

348
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,910
And getting back into the country

349
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,250
certainly hasn't been easy.

350
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,870
In terms of leaving the country,

351
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,350
we've heard, for example, as well from Athens,

352
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,890
the foreign ministry saying that it's working

353
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,830
to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.

354
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,670
Some of them were due to arrive

355
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,730
back late last night into Greece.

356
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,150
But there is indeed much concern

357
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,750
about many of the foreign workers in Israel.

358
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,850
I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers

359
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,010
in Israel and so governments around the world

360
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,690
are looking at how they can get their citizens home

361
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,330
if, indeed, they want to leave Israel.

362
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,070
All right, Katie Silva,

363
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,950
always a pleasure to have you on the program,

364
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,450
our business correspondent there in Singapore.

365
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,970
And we are remaining with this story

366
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,970
and we are now going to speak

367
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,070
to our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.

368
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,390
Good morning to you, Jeremy.

369
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,650
Now, you have called this a major Middle East crisis.

370
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,890
Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?

371
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,090
Well, it's unprecedented

372
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,630
that the Palestinian armed group Hamas

373
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,370
has been able to break out of Gaza,

374
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,950
which is surrounded by, if you like,

375
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,470
a ring of steel, of fences, wire fences and concrete,

376
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,930
break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis,

377
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,890
including many, many civilians.

378
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,490
That kind of thing is something

379
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,730
that Israel hasn't experienced before

380
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,210
and it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma

381
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,110
and plenty of people here compare it

382
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,790
to the 9-11 attacks in the United States.

383
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,230
There's even one article in one of the newspapers here

384
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,990
saying that if you adjust the death toll for population,

385
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,770
it's equivalent to the Americans

386
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,710
losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.

387
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,470
So it's a big, big event

388
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,310
and the Israeli response, which is going to be,

389
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,070
is already very heavy military action,

390
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,690
but they think there'll be a land invasion, too, of Gaza.

391
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,250
Now, that also is something

392
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,510
that could have reverberations right across the region.

393
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,310
So we're into really unexplored territory right now.

394
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,530
And, Jeremy, you have been in the region,

395
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,790
you have been in the area.

396
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,790
Just for our listeners' benefit,

397
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,370
can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like

398
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,770
and how that area is to Israel?

399
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:52,170
Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast,

400
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,290
which is surrounded mostly by Israel,

401
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:01,750
but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.

402
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,170
The Palestinian population of Gaza

403
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,130
is around 2.4 million people,

404
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,770
many of them are descendants of families

405
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,110
who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948,

406
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,750
a time that the Palestinians call the Nakba,

407
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,950
the catastrophe.

408
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,370
And it's an area where people are mostly very poor.

409
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,930
They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.

410
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,870
They're mostly not allowed to leave the area.

411
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,850
There are plenty of adults there who've never left.

412
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,810
And so it is a situation

413
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,790
which is life there is very hard

414
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,230
and it's highly nationalistic.

415
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,310
And since 2007, it's been controlled

416
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,970
by the Palestinian militant group, Hamas,

417
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,990
which is an Arabic acronym

418
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,730
for the Islamic resistance movement.

419
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,930
And you wrote a nice read on our website

420
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,930
where you said that Hamas blindsided Israel

421
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,530
with what you call the most serious attack

422
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,510
in a generation.

423
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,930
And we're hearing stories of hostages

424
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,870
that have been taken,

425
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,170
including civilians as well as soldiers.

426
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,650
What sort of challenge does this pose

427
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,490
for the government of Mr. Netanyahu

428
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,950
and the army going forward?

429
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,650
It's the most profound challenge

430
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,850
that any Israel government has, I think,

431
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,290
faced probably for 50 years

432
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,970
since the 1973 Middle East war.

433
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,570
His political enemies are already blaming him,

434
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,390
saying that he took his eye off the ball

435
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,230
for a variety of reasons.

436
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,210
It's clear that there's been,

437
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,390
from the Israeli perspective,

438
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,150
a huge intelligence failure

439
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,470
and they're struggling militarily

440
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,530
to assert themselves.

441
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,350
They will succeed in doing that.

442
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,750
I'm pretty certain

443
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,630
because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.

444
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,230
I think the big question, which was,

445
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,050
and this is probably an equal challenge

446
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,110
for the Israelis, is what happens after that?

447
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,690
How do they, what happens in Gaza

448
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,490
on the day that they leave?

449
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,530
Because the Israelis, who used to occupy Gaza

450
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,130
and finally pulled out in 2005,

451
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,290
do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation.

452
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,810
But if they send in their troops,

453
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,930
there's gonna have to be some kind of governance

454
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,070
of a territory which is maybe small,

455
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,030
but as I said,

456
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,790
contains getting on for two and a half million people.

457
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,130
Jeremy Bowen there,

458
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,490
thank you for coming on the program.

459
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,470
He is our international editor.

460
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,830
We're gonna move away from our top story.

461
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,830
We will return to it later on in the program though.

462
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,910
Isaac Fanon is here.

463
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,230
He's gonna give us some sports headlines.

464
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,750
Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goals,

465
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,890
but they finally beat Manchester City

466
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,870
in the Premier League.

467
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,550
Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal

468
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,430
in the 86th minute as City lost their second game

469
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,370
in the Premier League in a row.

470
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,630
It's the first time that's happened in five years.

471
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,950
European football's governing body, UEFA,

472
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,630
has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel

473
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,010
during the next fortnight,

474
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,090
amid increased tensions in the region.

475
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,010
Israel were due to play Switzerland

476
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,050
in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv,

477
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,890
but that game has been rescheduled

478
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,010
and UEFA said it will assess the situation

479
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,970
over the coming days to see whether

480
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,890
Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo

481
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,450
will still take place on the 15th of October.

482
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,270
To athletics news next,

483
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,070
Kenyan Kelvin Kipton shattered

484
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,690
the men's marathon world record in Chicago.

485
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,550
He beat his compatriot Elliot Kipchoge's

486
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,930
by more than 30 seconds.

487
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,550
The 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours,

488
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,290
35 seconds.

489
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,090
And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup,

490
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,230
despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal

491
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,090
in the final pool stage match.

492
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,910
Fiji got a losing bonus point

493
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,250
and they qualify at Australia's expense

494
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,250
due to their 22-15 victory way back in September.

495
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,250
Isaac, thank you very much indeed.

496
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,530
Now we are going to turn to Afghanistan

497
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,570
because thousands of people in the west of the country

498
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,010
are spending a second night in the open

499
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,090
after a strong earthquake on Saturday

500
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,490
reduced entire villages to rubble.

501
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,790
There's been confusion about the number of dead

502
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,830
with Taliban officials apologizing

503
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,110
for an early assessment

504
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,010
that more than 2,000 people had died.

505
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,310
The United Nations humanitarian agency

506
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,210
says that more than 1,000 have been killed

507
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,510
and more than 500 are still missing.

508
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,950
I'm now joined by my colleague

509
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,350
from the Afghan service, Angela Gehr.

510
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,930
Good morning to you, Angela.

511
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,050
What is the latest that you can tell us

512
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,790
about this devastating event?

513
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,370
Good morning.

514
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,690
The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is,

515
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:54,590
actually I can say that is a very, very, very big,

516
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,770
the darkest time that we are experiencing

517
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,330
in Afghanistan, the number that the Taliban are trying

518
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,390
to share with the media is very different

519
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,290
what we have receiving from the people.

520
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:24,130
I think in that area we had more than 20 violets

521
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:31,050
which are completely destroyed in the earthquake.

522
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,330
And also there is no way for the,

523
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,490
actually in the first half of the Taliban

524
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,270
tried to control the medias.

525
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,350
We didn't receive that.

526
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,430
Actually we felt that everything is not that bad

527
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:55,070
what we sent the volunteers group to the area.

528
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,310
And actually I'm so sorry.

529
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,310
I'm very-

530
00:27:59,310 --> 00:27:59,990
No, don't worry.

531
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,670
And so Angela, basically the Taliban have gone back

532
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,410
to what they said, the numbers have changed

533
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,090
but what are people saying on the ground,

534
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,450
those who've been affected?

535
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,470
They don't accept the numbers

536
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,470
which the Taliban is shedding.

537
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:22,490
Actually, and also I think more than 2000 people

538
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,250
are killed, 1000 people displaced

539
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,730
and 1000 people are missing in this crisis.

540
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,930
And we have nothing at that moment.

541
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:42,750
At this moment there are no big offer or support

542
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,750
from the Taliban for the people.

543
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:53,190
Just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help

544
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,850
for the people and the volunteers group from-

545
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,270
Angela.

546
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,410
In other cities.

547
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,510
Thank you so much for coming onto the program

00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,110

549
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,890
that has shaken Afghanistan in the worst of the country.

550
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,010
