00:20.780 --> 00:26.500
This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with

00:26.500 --> 00:29.660
more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza.

00:29.660 --> 00:31.560
Today, we hear from a woman in Gaza.

00:45.780 --> 00:51.860
In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival, the first

00:51.860 --> 00:53.460
site attacked by Hamas.

00:53.660 --> 00:57.660
We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that

00:57.660 --> 01:00.440
has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.

01:00.700 --> 01:05.460
And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000

01:05.460 --> 01:05.920
people.

01:06.220 --> 01:07.660
Rescue efforts are continuing.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.020
But first, we're getting a bulletin of World News.

01:13.870 --> 01:16.770
This is Danielle Yawowiecki with the BBC News.

01:16.870 --> 01:17.210
Hello.

01:17.830 --> 01:23.130
The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over

01:23.130 --> 01:26.050
500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

01:26.050 --> 01:31.650
Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside

01:31.650 --> 01:35.850
Israel two days after they carried out their devastating mass assault.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.590
More than 700 Israelis have been killed.

01:38.870 --> 01:40.390
John Donison is in Jerusalem.

01:41.170 --> 01:46.110
The Israeli military says it has continued to target Hamas infrastructure with airstrikes

01:46.110 --> 01:46.630
overnight.

01:47.350 --> 01:52.670
The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced, with many

01:52.670 --> 01:54.710
seeking shelter in UN schools.

01:54.710 --> 01:57.450
But most believe this is just the beginning.

01:57.990 --> 02:03.190
Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000

02:03.190 --> 02:04.450
army reservists.

02:04.650 --> 02:09.130
Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion, with Israel saying

02:09.130 --> 02:13.390
its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

02:14.010 --> 02:18.370
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far

02:18.370 --> 02:20.030
by Israeli airstrikes.

02:20.190 --> 02:22.030
Over 2,000 people have been injured.

02:22.030 --> 02:26.190
They said power cuts were widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical

02:26.190 --> 02:26.730
workers.

02:27.090 --> 02:30.210
Hamas said it had fired a new barrage of missiles into Israel.

02:30.710 --> 02:35.710
Three US air carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended

02:35.710 --> 02:37.070
flights to Tel Aviv.

02:38.130 --> 02:41.870
The United States says it's sending immediate extra munitions to Israel.

02:42.010 --> 02:46.410
The Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier,

02:46.510 --> 02:47.790
to the eastern Mediterranean.

02:48.350 --> 02:50.730
More from Barbara Plattusher in Washington.

02:51.150 --> 02:55.450
The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel

02:55.450 --> 02:57.950
and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.

02:58.390 --> 03:02.430
They're sending an aircraft carrier with a deck of warplanes, accompanied by cruisers

03:02.430 --> 03:03.410
and destroyers.

03:03.550 --> 03:06.290
Also extra military assistance, such as munitions.

03:06.610 --> 03:10.850
In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining

03:10.850 --> 03:11.350
the fight.

03:11.490 --> 03:15.030
It's backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas.

03:15.530 --> 03:20.470
There are reports that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack, although the Secretary

03:20.470 --> 03:24.690
of State Antony Blinken said the US hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.

03:25.130 --> 03:30.350
The UN Security Council has held an emergency closed-door session to discuss the crisis.

03:30.930 --> 03:35.530
The UN Middle East envoy called on countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore

03:35.530 --> 03:35.990
calm.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.330
More from Neda Taufiq in New York.

03:38.970 --> 03:41.930
Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement.

03:42.270 --> 03:44.290
Not all, but many, condemned Hamas.

03:44.730 --> 03:49.810
The UAE's ambassador to the UN, Lanin Acebe, told reporters there was real concern

03:49.810 --> 03:52.570
that tensions in the region could become inflamed.

03:52.910 --> 03:57.610
Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, showed graphic pictures

03:57.610 --> 04:00.910
of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.

04:01.190 --> 04:06.590
The Palestinian UN ambassador, Riyad Mansour, told reporters he'd requested an emergency

04:06.590 --> 04:09.010
meeting of Arab League states in Cairo.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.730
BBC World News.

04:12.790 --> 04:18.930
An independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into allegations that British

04:18.930 --> 04:24.030
special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians, including children, in Afghanistan.

04:24.810 --> 04:29.230
The inquiry was set up by the British government after legal action was brought by two Afghan

04:29.230 --> 04:29.850
families.

04:31.170 --> 04:35.750
The US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to

04:35.750 --> 04:38.210
China, has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

04:38.790 --> 04:42.810
Mr Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit, as Washington seeks

04:42.810 --> 04:44.370
to ease tensions with Beijing.

04:45.630 --> 04:50.950
Regional elections in two of Germany's largest and wealthiest states, Bavaria and Hesse,

04:51.390 --> 04:55.330
have dealt a blow to the parties that form the centre-left federal government.

04:55.710 --> 05:00.090
Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberal

05:00.090 --> 05:00.990
Free Democrats.

05:01.550 --> 05:04.230
The Christian Democrats again emerge as the largest party.

05:05.450 --> 05:10.090
The president of Ecuador has extended the state of emergency by 30 days.

05:10.090 --> 05:14.710
It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential

05:14.710 --> 05:17.170
candidate Fernando Villavicencio.

05:17.470 --> 05:21.390
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were

05:21.390 --> 05:22.350
found dead in prison.

05:23.650 --> 05:27.290
A hoard of coins believed to have belonged to a Highland clan chief, who was

05:27.290 --> 05:30.330
murdered more than 300 years ago, has been found in Scotland.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.450
Alexandra McKenzie reports.

05:33.010 --> 05:38.170
The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the first major excavation

05:38.170 --> 05:39.270
in Glencoe.

05:39.270 --> 05:44.150
The dig focused on scattered rocks believed to have been the McDonald clan chief's

05:44.150 --> 05:44.630
summer house.

05:44.830 --> 05:49.710
More than 300 years after he died in the Glencoe massacre, an archaeology

05:49.710 --> 05:53.330
student taking part in her first ever dig found the hoard.

05:53.590 --> 05:59.230
The University of Glasgow said the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins.

05:59.550 --> 06:04.130
A number of other artifacts were also discovered at the site, including a musket

06:04.130 --> 06:08.730
and fouling shot, pottery from across Europe and a powder major.

06:09.610 --> 06:10.810
BBC News.

06:14.510 --> 06:15.690
Thank you for that bulletin of news.

06:16.050 --> 06:19.990
Hello, your Newsday from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wohonda and Rob Young.

06:20.050 --> 06:23.070
Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue to focus on the conflict

06:23.070 --> 06:28.030
between Israel and Gaza with voices from both sides and we'll get all your

06:28.030 --> 06:30.370
sports and business headlines too.

06:34.270 --> 06:38.930
We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the

06:38.930 --> 06:42.290
numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.

06:42.810 --> 06:46.810
The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks

06:46.810 --> 06:49.530
overall, with more than 2000 injured.

06:49.690 --> 06:55.170
The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival

06:55.170 --> 06:59.730
attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.

06:59.730 --> 07:04.590
The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as

07:04.590 --> 07:07.910
the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.

07:08.450 --> 07:12.370
In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least

07:12.370 --> 07:17.750
400 people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2000 wounded, according to

07:17.750 --> 07:20.430
the latest update from the Palestinian officials.

07:21.010 --> 07:24.430
Video images show many buildings being blown up in large scale

07:24.430 --> 07:27.550
destruction, shops are closed, the streets are empty.

07:27.550 --> 07:31.070
The city is said to be like a ghost town.

07:31.470 --> 07:36.270
According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have now been

07:36.270 --> 07:40.530
displaced in Gaza because of the airstrikes and many Palestinians say

07:40.530 --> 07:43.090
they are now living in fear of their lives.

07:43.250 --> 07:46.570
In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.

07:47.310 --> 07:52.330
The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent

07:52.330 --> 07:58.590
and a huge Gaza is very highly dense populated area with very limited

07:58.590 --> 08:06.170
geographical area like with over two million people living in 360

08:06.170 --> 08:10.910
kilometers square, which make it each and every missile dropped very

08:10.910 --> 08:12.610
impactful and damaging.

08:13.490 --> 08:18.290
The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context

08:18.290 --> 08:24.290
of the Israeli ongoing decades long military occupation and settler

08:24.290 --> 08:29.950
colonization of Palestinian land and the imposition of a system of

08:29.950 --> 08:34.690
oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.

08:34.910 --> 08:41.270
Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17

08:41.270 --> 08:50.210
years against the Palestinians, refusing its population access to

08:50.210 --> 08:56.390
basic supplies and material needs to survive and trapping them in

08:56.390 --> 09:03.450
amounts to an open air prison with restrictions on right to movement,

09:03.670 --> 09:07.350
right to health and many other associated basic rights.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.710
Yet we were told as civilians to leave.

09:10.710 --> 09:15.310
I mean, leave and go where no crossings are open.

09:15.590 --> 09:19.710
Neither the sea that is also have restriction to some point.

09:20.430 --> 09:22.590
If you trespass, you can you can be shot.

09:22.810 --> 09:26.910
For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed,

09:27.150 --> 09:31.350
including women, children, elderly and persons with disabilities.

09:31.590 --> 09:35.970
I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school

09:35.970 --> 09:42.590
that not even fully prepared or accommodate these numbers and

09:42.590 --> 09:44.630
provide for their needs.

09:45.570 --> 09:49.210
I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws

09:49.210 --> 09:51.550
and conflicts and its principles.

09:51.710 --> 09:56.170
These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between

09:56.170 --> 10:05.490
competence and civilians, avoid disproportionate use of force and

10:05.490 --> 10:12.110
have have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies for the for

10:12.110 --> 10:12.970
the population.

10:13.830 --> 10:21.910
And now there is there is limited electricity and and and

10:21.910 --> 10:25.950
crossings are fully closed to let in any supplies.

10:26.310 --> 10:30.790
But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles.

10:30.930 --> 10:35.390
And the international community has to play a role in ending this

10:35.390 --> 10:38.110
bloodshed and killing of civilians.

10:39.090 --> 10:42.830
Our resident in Gaza, they are about what the last couple of days

10:42.830 --> 10:43.790
have been like.

10:43.850 --> 10:46.790
And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to

10:46.790 --> 10:48.950
BBC.com for a slash news.

10:49.070 --> 10:52.490
There is a live page of being updated as we get more news.

10:52.790 --> 10:55.710
Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the

10:55.710 --> 10:58.770
country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism,

10:59.050 --> 11:02.090
a former member of the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament,

11:02.270 --> 11:03.210
Mikhal Kotler-Vunch.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.590
Thanks so much for joining us.

11:05.390 --> 11:09.330
How is so much for how are Israelis feeling today?

11:11.030 --> 11:15.610
You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how

11:15.610 --> 11:19.990
Israelis are feeling is it actually encourages me to ask

11:19.990 --> 11:24.170
you the question, because, you know, when I hear the framing

11:24.170 --> 11:28.010
of what is happening in Israel, where a genocidal terror

11:28.010 --> 11:32.090
organization holding two million civilians in Gaza

11:32.090 --> 11:36.530
alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on

11:36.530 --> 11:40.930
Saturday morning, as we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath

11:40.930 --> 11:45.130
morning and a holiday in Israel, five thousand rockets

11:45.130 --> 11:49.090
launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas

11:49.090 --> 11:53.070
in Gaza, each rocket, a double war crime and a violation

11:53.070 --> 11:54.750
of international humanitarian law.

11:55.030 --> 11:58.510
When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that

11:58.510 --> 12:04.710
indiscriminately shot 260, at least, young party goers

12:04.710 --> 12:08.110
on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the

12:08.110 --> 12:13.280
anti-Semitic terror organization, Hamas, actually

12:13.470 --> 12:17.230
designated as a terror organization, funded and supported

12:17.230 --> 12:21.590
by a genocidal regime in Iran, holding its own

12:23.130 --> 12:27.230
civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza,

12:27.230 --> 12:29.990
in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11

12:29.990 --> 12:33.950
was a wake-up call to the West, that genocidal terror

12:33.950 --> 12:37.190
cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign

12:37.190 --> 12:39.810
democratic countries conduct ourselves.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.530
So I would turn the question to you, if this were

12:42.530 --> 12:45.430
happening anywhere else in the world, not only for

12:45.430 --> 12:49.290
Israel's right to defend its civilians, but Israel's

12:49.290 --> 12:52.430
indeed responsibility to defend its civilians, where

12:52.430 --> 12:56.950
the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours

12:56.950 --> 13:05.050
are indeed civilians in holding families of Holocaust

13:05.050 --> 13:08.210
survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip,

13:08.450 --> 13:12.170
of entire families being butchered in their homes.

13:13.130 --> 13:16.750
And to hear the way that the framing that BBC

13:16.750 --> 13:20.470
enables this situation is actually part and parcel

13:20.470 --> 13:24.630
of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue

13:24.630 --> 13:25.830
to dictate the discourse.

13:25.950 --> 13:28.130
Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to

13:28.130 --> 13:32.910
as many different people with as many perspectives

13:32.910 --> 13:33.830
on this as we can.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.630
I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got

13:36.630 --> 13:40.190
a sense from you of the anger there is,

13:40.270 --> 13:41.610
and the sadness, too.

13:41.610 --> 13:42.430
No, there is no anger.

13:42.550 --> 13:43.930
We are fighting for our lives.

13:44.110 --> 13:45.050
There is no anger.

13:45.230 --> 13:46.250
Let it be clear.

13:46.770 --> 13:50.710
You said that this is like Israel's 9-11.

13:51.390 --> 13:54.610
Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?

13:55.630 --> 13:57.210
It's not just because of this shock.

13:57.390 --> 13:59.790
It's because of the same modus operandi.

14:00.330 --> 14:04.370
This is a terror organization listed as such in most

14:04.370 --> 14:06.810
of the countries that are listening to us at the moment.

14:07.470 --> 14:10.550
Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign

14:10.550 --> 14:13.690
country that must defend its citizens from terror.

14:13.690 --> 14:17.830
You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want

14:17.830 --> 14:20.110
to understand what Israelis are feeling.

14:20.410 --> 14:21.830
There is no both sides.

14:22.050 --> 14:26.830
When a terror organization ravages civilian areas,

14:27.690 --> 14:29.970
enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets

14:29.970 --> 14:33.330
targeting those civilians, breaking barriers,

14:33.710 --> 14:34.670
that there is a fence.

14:34.710 --> 14:38.730
There has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.

14:39.270 --> 14:40.570
And the voices that you are listening to in Gaza...

14:40.570 --> 14:41.090
There has been a blockade, though,

14:41.150 --> 14:41.890
hasn't there, of Gaza?

14:41.890 --> 14:45.110
No, there is no blockade because there are thousands,

14:45.470 --> 14:48.730
thousands of workers entering Gaza every day

14:48.730 --> 14:49.730
to work in Israel.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.350
There are thousands of truckloads.

14:52.510 --> 14:54.990
There is electricity and water still being supplied,

14:54.990 --> 14:57.150
although Hamas has responsibility

14:57.150 --> 14:58.850
for the civilians in Gaza,

14:58.870 --> 15:02.670
because that's who was elected to reign over Gaza.

15:02.830 --> 15:04.070
And there is a responsibility

15:04.070 --> 15:05.770
of the international community

15:05.770 --> 15:07.870
and of all those that cherish life and liberty

15:07.870 --> 15:09.550
to hold Hamas to account

15:09.550 --> 15:13.030
for holding those 2 million civilians in Gaza

15:13.030 --> 15:15.050
hostage to their war crimes,

15:15.290 --> 15:17.910
not only on Israel, but on Gaza's civilians.

15:17.990 --> 15:20.270
How do you think the Israeli military should respond then?

15:20.410 --> 15:21.750
We've seen, we're told,

15:21.770 --> 15:25.450
more than 500 airstrikes over the weekend.

15:25.670 --> 15:26.850
How do you think the Israeli military should,

15:26.850 --> 15:28.030
how do you think any other country

15:28.030 --> 15:30.050
Well, my job is to ask questions, not answer them.

15:30.670 --> 15:32.970
Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do

15:32.970 --> 15:34.290
in order to protect its civilians

15:34.290 --> 15:35.190
when they're being attacked,

15:35.450 --> 15:38.410
including as we speak, in their homes,

15:38.410 --> 15:39.950
including as we speak.

15:40.110 --> 15:43.250
There is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror.

15:43.590 --> 15:46.310
This is not two countries fighting each other.

15:46.590 --> 15:49.170
A genocidal terror organization, ISIS, if you will,

15:49.530 --> 15:52.270
9-11, needs moral clarity.

15:52.490 --> 15:55.230
And this is not just about Jews around the world

15:55.230 --> 15:56.390
who are now under attack.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.170
So to my question,

15:57.290 --> 15:58.910
how do you think the military should respond?

15:58.970 --> 16:02.070
There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion

16:02.070 --> 16:05.370
of Gaza, although we're told there are dozens

16:05.930 --> 16:10.090
of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment.

16:10.290 --> 16:12.230
Do you think a ground invasion is the way

16:12.230 --> 16:14.130
for the Israeli government to go?

16:14.990 --> 16:17.870
There are dozens of Israeli hostages

16:17.870 --> 16:20.690
and many of them are civilians that were abducted,

16:21.170 --> 16:22.010
many of them raped,

16:22.510 --> 16:25.210
many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza

16:25.210 --> 16:26.310
and celebrated.

16:26.990 --> 16:30.410
And the Israeli IDF will do everything

16:30.410 --> 16:33.150
that it needs to do to protect, as it must,

16:33.150 --> 16:35.870
the citizens of the State of Israel under attack

16:35.870 --> 16:36.870
as we speak.

16:37.790 --> 16:42.150
And every country that cherishes life and liberty

16:42.150 --> 16:47.230
must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught,

16:47.890 --> 16:49.650
massacre of its civilians.

16:49.910 --> 16:51.670
And those hostages that have been held

16:51.670 --> 16:54.010
are being held by a genocidal terror organization.

16:54.010 --> 16:55.610
And I wanna make it very clear,

16:55.830 --> 16:58.290
alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers

16:58.290 --> 17:00.010
and two civilians that have been held

17:00.010 --> 17:02.170
by the same genocidal terror organization

17:02.170 --> 17:04.830
in a nine-year standing violation

17:04.830 --> 17:06.630
of international law and human rights.

17:07.210 --> 17:08.690
And each one of those civilians

17:08.690 --> 17:10.450
and every one of our countries

17:10.450 --> 17:13.350
must call for the immediate and unconditional return

17:13.350 --> 17:16.470
because it is countries supporting Gaza

17:16.470 --> 17:20.110
and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization,

17:20.410 --> 17:23.610
to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.

17:24.050 --> 17:25.730
And what IDF will have to do

17:25.730 --> 17:27.290
and the State of Israel will have to do

17:27.290 --> 17:28.690
in its existential war

17:28.690 --> 17:30.490
is not just about the State of Israel.

17:30.490 --> 17:32.450
I wanna make it very clear to your listeners.

17:33.090 --> 17:34.750
Michal Kotler-Vunch, we gotta leave it there.

17:34.790 --> 17:35.970
Thanks for joining us.

17:36.710 --> 17:37.830
Well, same with this story

17:37.830 --> 17:40.330
and looking at the business side of things.

17:40.490 --> 17:43.430
One industry that's already feeling the impact

17:43.430 --> 17:46.050
of this conflict is the aviation industry

17:46.050 --> 17:48.330
with dozens of flights already canceled.

17:48.750 --> 17:51.330
Let's get the details with our business correspondent

17:51.330 --> 17:53.010
in Singapore, Katie Silva.

17:53.150 --> 17:54.550
Katie, what are we seeing?

17:56.030 --> 17:57.110
Well, yeah, as you mentioned,

17:57.270 --> 17:58.950
many airlines canceling flights.

17:58.950 --> 18:01.810
The likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France,

18:01.970 --> 18:04.970
Lufthansa, Emirates, and Ryanair all cancel journeys.

18:05.470 --> 18:07.390
British Airways, for its part, told the BBC

18:07.390 --> 18:10.290
that it's only canceled one flight on Sunday

18:10.290 --> 18:12.830
and that it's going to be adjusting departure times

18:12.830 --> 18:14.050
for flights in the coming days.

18:14.090 --> 18:15.550
And that's unclear if that's because

18:15.550 --> 18:17.170
of disruption at the airport

18:17.170 --> 18:19.290
or if perhaps they want to land

18:19.290 --> 18:21.570
at different times of the day that may be deemed safer.

18:22.130 --> 18:24.950
Many of these airlines are also offering passengers

18:24.950 --> 18:27.610
to cancel their flights or to move the dates

18:27.610 --> 18:29.850
with no sort of change fees.

18:30.650 --> 18:32.930
Flights to Israel's second international airport,

18:33.190 --> 18:35.150
Eliat, which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea,

18:35.150 --> 18:36.370
they've been unaffected.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.230
But we've also heard that Israeli's flag carrier, El Al,

18:39.610 --> 18:41.530
it's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights

18:41.530 --> 18:43.190
to Tel Aviv for now, but again,

18:43.310 --> 18:47.610
allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.

18:48.070 --> 18:49.790
But Katie, this also comes at the same time

18:49.790 --> 18:51.650
as many Israelis are trying

18:51.650 --> 18:53.770
or desperately trying to leave.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.470
To leave, well, as well as to get home.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.650
So that's one of the major issues

18:58.650 --> 19:00.550
is that many have found themselves stranded

19:00.550 --> 19:02.970
and with fears about whether or not

19:04.190 --> 19:05.790
the airspace will be closed.

19:06.230 --> 19:07.530
So one of our reporters, for example,

19:07.530 --> 19:09.310
was actually there amongst them,

19:09.390 --> 19:10.410
stranded in Cyprus,

19:10.610 --> 19:13.050
at Lanica International Airport late last night.

19:13.710 --> 19:14.730
Hundreds were packing in,

19:14.790 --> 19:15.990
hundreds of Israelis hoping

19:15.990 --> 19:17.690
to get one of the last flights home.

19:18.010 --> 19:20.230
As I say, rumors about whether or not

19:20.230 --> 19:21.990
the country may close its airspace.

19:22.390 --> 19:24.050
It was hard to get tickets, we understand.

19:24.210 --> 19:25.770
Dozens were waiting to get the seats,

19:25.770 --> 19:28.270
for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights.

19:28.870 --> 19:29.910
And getting back into the country

19:29.910 --> 19:31.250
certainly hasn't been easy.

19:31.610 --> 19:32.870
In terms of leaving the country,

19:33.010 --> 19:35.350
we've heard, for example, as well from Athens,

19:35.450 --> 19:36.890
the foreign ministry saying that it's working

19:36.890 --> 19:40.830
to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.

19:41.450 --> 19:42.670
Some of them were due to arrive

19:42.670 --> 19:44.730
back late last night into Greece.

19:44.770 --> 19:47.150
But there is indeed much concern

19:47.150 --> 19:49.750
about many of the foreign workers in Israel.

19:49.950 --> 19:52.850
I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers

19:52.850 --> 19:55.010
in Israel and so governments around the world

19:55.010 --> 19:56.690
are looking at how they can get their citizens home

19:56.690 --> 19:58.330
if, indeed, they want to leave Israel.

19:59.010 --> 20:00.070
All right, Katie Silva,

20:00.250 --> 20:01.950
always a pleasure to have you on the program,

20:02.070 --> 20:04.450
our business correspondent there in Singapore.

20:04.750 --> 20:06.970
And we are remaining with this story

20:06.970 --> 20:07.970
and we are now going to speak

20:07.970 --> 20:11.070
to our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.

20:11.130 --> 20:12.390
Good morning to you, Jeremy.

20:12.490 --> 20:16.650
Now, you have called this a major Middle East crisis.

20:16.810 --> 20:18.890
Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?

20:20.290 --> 20:22.090
Well, it's unprecedented

20:22.090 --> 20:26.630
that the Palestinian armed group Hamas

20:26.630 --> 20:29.370
has been able to break out of Gaza,

20:29.530 --> 20:31.950
which is surrounded by, if you like,

20:32.050 --> 20:35.470
a ring of steel, of fences, wire fences and concrete,

20:36.150 --> 20:40.930
break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis,

20:41.050 --> 20:42.890
including many, many civilians.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.490
That kind of thing is something

20:45.490 --> 20:47.730
that Israel hasn't experienced before

20:47.730 --> 20:53.210
and it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma

20:53.210 --> 20:56.110
and plenty of people here compare it

20:56.110 --> 20:58.790
to the 9-11 attacks in the United States.

20:59.250 --> 21:02.230
There's even one article in one of the newspapers here

21:02.230 --> 21:04.990
saying that if you adjust the death toll for population,

21:05.510 --> 21:06.770
it's equivalent to the Americans

21:06.770 --> 21:09.710
losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.

21:09.850 --> 21:13.470
So it's a big, big event

21:13.470 --> 21:16.310
and the Israeli response, which is going to be,

21:16.310 --> 21:19.070
is already very heavy military action,

21:19.370 --> 21:22.690
but they think there'll be a land invasion, too, of Gaza.

21:23.390 --> 21:25.250
Now, that also is something

21:25.250 --> 21:28.510
that could have reverberations right across the region.

21:28.870 --> 21:32.310
So we're into really unexplored territory right now.

21:33.590 --> 21:35.530
And, Jeremy, you have been in the region,

21:35.550 --> 21:36.790
you have been in the area.

21:36.890 --> 21:38.790
Just for our listeners' benefit,

21:38.850 --> 21:41.370
can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like

21:41.370 --> 21:43.770
and how that area is to Israel?

21:45.770 --> 21:52.170
Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast,

21:52.610 --> 21:55.290
which is surrounded mostly by Israel,

21:56.610 --> 22:01.750
but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.

22:03.650 --> 22:06.170
The Palestinian population of Gaza

22:06.170 --> 22:09.130
is around 2.4 million people,

22:09.490 --> 22:12.770
many of them are descendants of families

22:12.770 --> 22:17.110
who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948,

22:17.510 --> 22:19.750
a time that the Palestinians call the Nakba,

22:20.090 --> 22:20.950
the catastrophe.

22:22.150 --> 22:25.370
And it's an area where people are mostly very poor.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.930
They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.

22:29.270 --> 22:31.870
They're mostly not allowed to leave the area.

22:32.330 --> 22:35.850
There are plenty of adults there who've never left.

22:37.030 --> 22:39.810
And so it is a situation

22:39.810 --> 22:42.790
which is life there is very hard

22:42.790 --> 22:44.230
and it's highly nationalistic.

22:44.470 --> 22:47.310
And since 2007, it's been controlled

22:47.310 --> 22:49.970
by the Palestinian militant group, Hamas,

22:50.090 --> 22:51.990
which is an Arabic acronym

22:51.990 --> 22:53.730
for the Islamic resistance movement.

22:54.230 --> 22:57.930
And you wrote a nice read on our website

22:57.930 --> 23:00.930
where you said that Hamas blindsided Israel

23:00.930 --> 23:03.530
with what you call the most serious attack

23:03.530 --> 23:04.510
in a generation.

23:04.770 --> 23:06.930
And we're hearing stories of hostages

23:06.930 --> 23:07.870
that have been taken,

23:07.870 --> 23:10.170
including civilians as well as soldiers.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.650
What sort of challenge does this pose

23:12.650 --> 23:14.490
for the government of Mr. Netanyahu

23:14.490 --> 23:15.950
and the army going forward?

23:17.030 --> 23:18.650
It's the most profound challenge

23:18.650 --> 23:20.850
that any Israel government has, I think,

23:21.150 --> 23:23.290
faced probably for 50 years

23:23.290 --> 23:25.970
since the 1973 Middle East war.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.570
His political enemies are already blaming him,

23:31.570 --> 23:34.390
saying that he took his eye off the ball

23:34.390 --> 23:36.230
for a variety of reasons.

23:36.870 --> 23:38.210
It's clear that there's been,

23:38.230 --> 23:39.390
from the Israeli perspective,

23:39.550 --> 23:41.150
a huge intelligence failure

23:41.710 --> 23:43.470
and they're struggling militarily

23:43.470 --> 23:44.530
to assert themselves.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.350
They will succeed in doing that.

23:46.610 --> 23:47.750
I'm pretty certain

23:47.750 --> 23:50.630
because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.

23:51.410 --> 23:54.230
I think the big question, which was,

23:54.230 --> 23:58.050
and this is probably an equal challenge

23:58.050 --> 24:02.110
for the Israelis, is what happens after that?

24:02.450 --> 24:05.690
How do they, what happens in Gaza

24:05.690 --> 24:07.490
on the day that they leave?

24:07.750 --> 24:10.530
Because the Israelis, who used to occupy Gaza

24:10.530 --> 24:14.130
and finally pulled out in 2005,

24:15.410 --> 24:18.290
do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation.

24:18.330 --> 24:19.810
But if they send in their troops,

24:20.590 --> 24:22.930
there's gonna have to be some kind of governance

24:22.930 --> 24:26.070
of a territory which is maybe small,

24:26.090 --> 24:27.030
but as I said,

24:28.150 --> 24:30.790
contains getting on for two and a half million people.

24:31.890 --> 24:33.130
Jeremy Bowen there,

24:33.130 --> 24:34.490
thank you for coming on the program.

24:34.490 --> 24:36.470
He is our international editor.

24:43.410 --> 24:44.830
We're gonna move away from our top story.

24:44.910 --> 24:46.830
We will return to it later on in the program though.

24:47.070 --> 24:47.910
Isaac Fanon is here.

24:47.990 --> 24:49.230
He's gonna give us some sports headlines.

24:49.350 --> 24:50.750
Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goals,

24:50.810 --> 24:52.890
but they finally beat Manchester City

24:52.890 --> 24:53.870
in the Premier League.

24:54.070 --> 24:55.550
Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal

24:55.550 --> 24:58.430
in the 86th minute as City lost their second game

24:58.430 --> 25:00.370
in the Premier League in a row.

25:00.530 --> 25:02.630
It's the first time that's happened in five years.

25:03.290 --> 25:04.950
European football's governing body, UEFA,

25:05.070 --> 25:07.630
has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel

25:07.630 --> 25:09.010
during the next fortnight,

25:09.090 --> 25:11.090
amid increased tensions in the region.

25:11.090 --> 25:13.010
Israel were due to play Switzerland

25:13.010 --> 25:16.050
in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv,

25:16.150 --> 25:17.890
but that game has been rescheduled

25:17.890 --> 25:20.010
and UEFA said it will assess the situation

25:20.010 --> 25:21.970
over the coming days to see whether

25:21.970 --> 25:24.890
Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo

25:24.890 --> 25:27.450
will still take place on the 15th of October.

25:27.930 --> 25:29.270
To athletics news next,

25:29.570 --> 25:31.070
Kenyan Kelvin Kipton shattered

25:31.070 --> 25:33.690
the men's marathon world record in Chicago.

25:33.910 --> 25:36.550
He beat his compatriot Elliot Kipchoge's

25:36.810 --> 25:38.930
by more than 30 seconds.

25:39.310 --> 25:41.550
The 23-year-old finished in a time of two hours,

25:41.950 --> 25:43.290
35 seconds.

25:43.790 --> 25:46.090
And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup,

25:46.150 --> 25:49.230
despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal

25:49.230 --> 25:51.090
in the final pool stage match.

25:51.330 --> 25:52.910
Fiji got a losing bonus point

25:52.910 --> 25:55.250
and they qualify at Australia's expense

25:55.250 --> 25:59.250
due to their 22-15 victory way back in September.

26:00.010 --> 26:01.250
Isaac, thank you very much indeed.

26:02.190 --> 26:05.530
Now we are going to turn to Afghanistan

26:05.530 --> 26:08.570
because thousands of people in the west of the country

26:08.570 --> 26:11.010
are spending a second night in the open

26:11.010 --> 26:13.090
after a strong earthquake on Saturday

26:13.090 --> 26:15.490
reduced entire villages to rubble.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.790
There's been confusion about the number of dead

26:17.790 --> 26:19.830
with Taliban officials apologizing

26:19.830 --> 26:21.110
for an early assessment

26:21.110 --> 26:24.010
that more than 2,000 people had died.

26:24.210 --> 26:26.310
The United Nations humanitarian agency

26:26.310 --> 26:29.210
says that more than 1,000 have been killed

26:29.210 --> 26:31.510
and more than 500 are still missing.

26:31.910 --> 26:33.950
I'm now joined by my colleague

26:33.950 --> 26:36.350
from the Afghan service, Angela Gehr.

26:36.490 --> 26:37.930
Good morning to you, Angela.

26:38.210 --> 26:40.050
What is the latest that you can tell us

26:40.050 --> 26:41.790
about this devastating event?

26:43.010 --> 26:44.370
Good morning.

26:45.790 --> 26:49.690
The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is,

26:50.890 --> 26:54.590
actually I can say that is a very, very, very big,

26:59.870 --> 27:03.770
the darkest time that we are experiencing

27:03.770 --> 27:08.330
in Afghanistan, the number that the Taliban are trying

27:08.330 --> 27:12.390
to share with the media is very different

27:12.390 --> 27:16.290
what we have receiving from the people.

27:17.050 --> 27:24.130
I think in that area we had more than 20 violets

27:24.130 --> 27:31.050
which are completely destroyed in the earthquake.

27:31.390 --> 27:35.330
And also there is no way for the,

27:35.570 --> 27:37.490
actually in the first half of the Taliban

27:37.490 --> 27:39.270
tried to control the medias.

27:39.770 --> 27:41.350
We didn't receive that.

27:41.350 --> 27:45.430
Actually we felt that everything is not that bad

27:47.690 --> 27:55.070
what we sent the volunteers group to the area.

27:55.970 --> 27:58.310
And actually I'm so sorry.

27:58.670 --> 27:59.310
I'm very-

27:59.310 --> 27:59.990
No, don't worry.

27:59.990 --> 28:03.670
And so Angela, basically the Taliban have gone back

28:03.670 --> 28:05.410
to what they said, the numbers have changed

28:05.410 --> 28:08.090
but what are people saying on the ground,

28:08.190 --> 28:09.450
those who've been affected?

28:11.250 --> 28:14.470
They don't accept the numbers

28:14.470 --> 28:16.470
which the Taliban is shedding.

28:17.450 --> 28:22.490
Actually, and also I think more than 2000 people

28:22.490 --> 28:26.250
are killed, 1000 people displaced

28:26.250 --> 28:31.730
and 1000 people are missing in this crisis.

28:33.270 --> 28:36.930
And we have nothing at that moment.

28:37.270 --> 28:42.750
At this moment there are no big offer or support

28:42.750 --> 28:45.750
from the Taliban for the people.

28:46.950 --> 28:53.190
Just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help

28:53.190 --> 28:56.850
for the people and the volunteers group from-

28:56.850 --> 28:57.270
Angela.

28:57.290 --> 28:58.410
In other cities.

28:58.590 --> 29:00.510
Thank you so much for coming onto the program

29:00.510 --> 29:03.110
telling us about the devastating earthquake

29:03.110 --> 29:05.890
that has shaken Afghanistan in the worst of the country.

29:05.990 --> 29:08.010
