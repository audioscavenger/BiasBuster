369370	370330	BBC News.
373890	375450	Thank you for that bulletin of news.
375450	379870	Hello, you're with Newsday from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wohunder and Rob Young.
380070	384430	Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue to focus on the conflict between Israel and Gaza
384430	389950	with voices from both sides and that will get all your sports and business headlines to.
394550	402110	We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.
402110	409370	The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall with more than 2,000 injured.
409690	414990	The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival
414990	419550	attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.
419990	427650	The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.
427650	436590	In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2,000 wounded,
436930	439820	according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.
440810	444970	Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale distraction.
445570	450730	Shops are closed, the streets are empty, the city is said to be like a ghost town.
451130	457430	According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have not been displaced in Gaza
457430	463010	because of the airstrikes and many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.
463190	466310	In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.
467050	472990	The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.
473550	480930	Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with very limited geographical area,
480930	487250	like with over 2 million people living in 360 kilometers square,
487910	492470	which make each and every missile dropped very impactful and damaging.
493390	500390	The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing
500840	506350	decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian land
506350	513630	and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.
514170	524150	Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal plocate on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians,
526830	534170	refusing its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive
534170	543270	and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison with restrictions on right to movement,
543590	547130	right to health and many other associated basic rights.
547510	552630	Yet we were told as civilians to leave, I mean, leave and go where.
553630	556830	No crossings are open, neither the sea.
557170	559590	That is also a restriction to some point.
560310	562430	If you trespass, you can be shot.
562430	568870	For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed, including women, children, elderly
568870	576390	and persons with disabilities. I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school shelters
576390	584390	that not even fully prepared or accommodate these numbers and provide for their needs.
585070	591410	I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws and conflicts and its principles.
591410	597770	These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and civilians,
598190	611050	avoid disproportionate use of force and have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies
611050	625710	for the population. And now there is limited electricity and crossings are fully closed to let any supplies.
626650	630630	But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles.
631250	637850	And the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.
638670	643750	Our resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like.
643770	648850	And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com for a slash news.
649110	652370	There is a live page of being updated as we get more news.
652530	658710	Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism.
658890	663130	Former member of the Knessetli-Israeli parliament, Mikhail Kotler-Vunch.
663330	664410	Thanks so much for joining us.
665710	666870	Thank you so much for having me.
666870	669070	How are Israelis feeling today?
670350	676870	You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is...
677410	680730	it actually encourages me to ask you the question.
680970	685770	Because, you know, when I hear the framing of what is happening in Israel,
686230	694950	where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in Gaza alongside all those civilians in Israel
694950	702450	that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel,
702890	709530	5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza,
709990	714650	each rocket a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.
714930	721810	When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260, at least,
721810	726390	young party-goers on that very day of the holiday,
726810	732310	when I think of the anti-Semitic terror organization, Hamas,
732450	739550	actually designated as a terror organization funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran,
739950	747050	holding its own civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza,
747050	751930	in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West,
752350	759610	that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.
760010	764250	So I would turn the question to you, if this were happening anywhere else in the world,
764510	768090	not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians,
768410	771970	but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians,
771970	779530	where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians
779530	788070	and holding families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip,
788290	791970	of entire families being butchered in their homes,
792570	800370	and to hear the way that the framing that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel
800370	805770	of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.
805950	813730	Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives on this as we can.
813930	821630	I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got a sense from you of the anger there is, and the sadness too.
821830	826150	No, there is no anger. We are fighting for our lives. There is no anger. Let it be clear.
826150	834410	You said that this is like Israel's 9-11. Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?
835230	839570	It's not just because of this shock. It's because of the same modus operandi.
839990	846590	This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us at the moment.
847010	853490	Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that must defend its citizens from terror.
853490	859950	You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand what Israelis are feeling.
860230	866370	There is no both sides when a terror organization ravages civilian areas,
866770	871410	enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians,
871830	878450	breaking barriers that there is a fence. There has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.
879270	881770	There has been a blockade, though, hasn't there, of Gaza?
881930	889530	No, there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every day to work in Israel.
889850	894830	There are thousands of truckloads. There is electricity and water still being supplied,
894970	898750	although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza,
898770	902470	because that's who was elected to reign over Gaza.
902710	905510	And there is a responsibility of the international community
905510	908830	and of all those that cherish life and liberty to hold Hamas
908830	914930	to account for holding those 2 million civilians in Gaza hostage to their war crimes,
915230	917730	not only on Israel, but on Gaza's civilians.
918010	920210	How do you think the Israeli military should respond, then?
920290	925470	We've seen, I've told, more than 500 airstrikes over the weekend.
925490	926990	How do you think Israeli military should...
927410	929970	Well, my job is to ask questions, not answer them.
930350	934190	Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect its civilians
934190	939890	when they're being attacked, including as we speak, in their homes, including as we speak.
940010	943070	There is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror.
943530	946130	This is not two countries fighting each other.
946410	952070	A genocidal terror organization, ISIS, if you will, 9-11, needs moral clarity.
952430	956310	And this is not just about Jews around the world who are now under attack.
956310	958830	So to my question, how do you think the military should respond?
958970	963110	There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza,
963110	969830	although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment.
970350	973950	Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government to go?
974810	980350	There are dozens of Israeli hostages, and many of them are civilians that were abducted.
980730	986010	Many of them raped. Many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated.
986010	992890	And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must.
993330	996710	The citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak.
997350	1004470	And every country that cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens
1004470	1009470	from an ongoing onslaught, massacre of its civilians.
1009850	1013930	And those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization.
1013930	1018130	And I want to make it very clear, alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers
1018130	1021930	and two civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization
1021930	1026470	in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.
1027130	1030230	And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries
1030230	1033250	must call for the immediate and unconditional return
1033250	1038230	because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas,
1038370	1043430	a genocidal terror organization, to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.
1043430	1047070	And what the IDF will have to do and the state of Israel will have to do
1047070	1050410	in its existential war is not just about the state of Israel.
1050550	1052370	I want to make it very clear to your listeners.
1052610	1055550	Mikaela, Katla, Vunch, we've got to leave it there. Thanks for joining us.
1056290	1060230	Well, staying with this story and looking at the business side of things.
1060410	1064210	One industry that's already filling the impact of this conflict
1064210	1068150	is the aviation industry with dozens of flights already canceled.
1068690	1071990	Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore,
1071990	1074430	Katie Silva. Katie, what are we seeing?
1075690	1078850	Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines canceling flights.
1079050	1083530	The likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair
1083530	1087250	all canceled journeys. British Airways for its part told the BBC
1087250	1090170	that it's only canceled one flight on Sunday
1090170	1093970	and that it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days.
1094050	1097070	And that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport
1097070	1100270	or if perhaps they want to land at different times of the day
1100270	1101450	that may be deemed safer.
1102110	1106310	Many of these airlines are also offering passengers to cancel their flights
1106310	1109410	or to move the dates with no sort of change fees.
1110210	1113390	Flights to Israel's second international airport, Iliad,
1113590	1116150	which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea, they've been unaffected.
1116410	1119030	But we've also heard that Israelis flag carrier LL.
1119430	1122410	It's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now
1122410	1127390	but again allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.
1127390	1131570	But this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying
1131570	1133550	or desperately trying to leave.
1134950	1137370	To leave as well as to get home.
1137530	1140470	So that's one of the major issues is that many have found themselves stranded
1140470	1145630	and with fears about whether or not the airspace will be closed.
1145970	1149030	So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there amongst them
1149030	1152550	stranded in Cyprus at Lanikah International Airport late last night.
1153370	1157110	Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights.
1157110	1161850	As I say, rumors about whether or not the country may close its airspace.
1162430	1163930	It was hard to get tickets, we understand.
1164130	1167990	Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights
1167990	1171070	and getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.
1171530	1175170	In terms of leaving the country, I've heard for example as well from Athens,
1175410	1177850	the foreign ministry, saying that it's working to repatriate
1177850	1180670	about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.
1181130	1184610	Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece.
1184610	1189650	But there is indeed much concern about many of the foreign workers in Israel.
1189830	1193310	I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel.
1193570	1196630	And so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home
1196630	1198110	if indeed they want to leave Israel.
1198530	1201870	All right, Katie Silva, it's a pleasure to have you on the program.
1201970	1204170	Our business correspondent there in Singapore.
1204430	1206890	And we are remaining with this story.
1206970	1211010	And we are now going to speak to our international editor Jeremy Bowen.
1211150	1212190	Good morning to you Jeremy.
1212190	1216410	Now you have called this a major Middle East crisis.
1216850	1218770	Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?
1219670	1226230	Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas
1226230	1231430	has been able to break out of Gaza, which is surrounded by,
1231490	1235190	if you like, a ring of steel, of fences, wire fences and concrete.
1235850	1240790	Break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis,
1240790	1242610	including many, many civilians.
1243530	1247410	That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before.
1248310	1253110	And it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma
1253110	1258470	and plenty of people here compare it to the 9-11 attacks in the United States.
1259030	1262570	There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that
1262570	1264870	if you adjust the death toll for population,
1265110	1269570	it's equivalent of the Americans losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.
1269570	1273270	So it's a big, big event.
1273650	1279010	And the Israeli response, which is going to be, is already very heavy military action,
1279130	1282510	but I think there'll be a land invasion, too, of Gaza.
1283390	1288350	Now, that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region.
1288750	1292090	So we're into really unexplored territory right now.
1292730	1296710	And Jeremy, you have been in the region, you have been in the area.
1296710	1301170	Just for our listeners' benefit, can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like
1301170	1303550	and how that area is to Israel?
1305750	1312010	Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast,
1312310	1314810	which is surrounded mostly by Israel,
1315850	1321450	but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.
1323490	1328850	The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.
1329490	1333790	Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes
1333790	1336790	when Israel was created in 1948,
1337230	1340650	a time that the Palestinians called the Nakba, the catastrophe.
1341670	1345190	And it's an area where people are mostly very poor.
1345530	1348810	They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.
1348810	1351670	They're mostly not allowed to leave the area.
1352330	1355670	There are plenty of adults there who've never left.
1356790	1362710	And so it is a situation which is... life there is very hard
1362710	1365730	and it's highly nationalistic and since 2007,
1366090	1369850	it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas,
1370010	1373570	which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement.
1374030	1377810	And you wrote a nice read on our website
1377810	1380690	where you said that Hamas blindsided Israel
1380690	1384370	with what you called most the serious attack in a generation.
1384790	1387730	And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken,
1387850	1389870	including civilians as well as soldiers.
1390530	1392530	What sort of challenge does this pose
1392530	1395730	for the government of Mr. Netanyahu and the army going forward?
1396830	1399750	It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government
1399750	1403090	has, I think, faced probably for 50 years
1403090	1405710	since the 1973 Middle East War.
1408310	1411430	His political enemies are already blaming him,
1411590	1415910	saying that he took his afterball for a variety of reasons.
1416590	1418950	It's clear that there's been, from the Israeli perspective,
1419490	1420930	a huge intelligence failure
1420930	1424370	and they're struggling militarily to assert themselves.
1424690	1426290	They will succeed in doing that.
1426390	1430370	I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.
1431250	1433970	I think the big question, which was...
1433970	1439270	and this is probably an equal challenge for the Israelis,
1439890	1441830	is what happens after that.
1442410	1444250	How do they...
1444250	1447410	what happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?
1447510	1450470	Because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza
1450470	1453790	and finally pulled out in 2005
1455310	1458190	do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation.
1458210	1459610	But if they sent in their troops,
1460470	1462610	there's going to have to be some kind of governance
1463150	1465970	of a territory which is maybe small,
1466090	1470610	but, as I said, contains getting on for 2.5 million people.
1471990	1472990	Jeremy Bowen there.
1473190	1474390	Thank you for coming on the programme.
1474610	1476110	He is our international editor.
1483210	1484730	Going to move away from our top story.
1484930	1486650	We will return to it later on in the programme, though.
1486990	1489090	Isaac Fanon is here. He's going to give us some sports headlines.
1489350	1490610	Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goes,
1490810	1493810	but they finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League.
1493810	1496390	Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th minute
1496390	1500250	as City lost their second game in the Premier League in a row.
1500410	1502470	It was the first time that's happened in five years.
1502910	1505390	European football's governing body UEFA has postponed
1505390	1508630	all matches scheduled in Israel during the next fortnight
1508630	1510930	amid increased tensions in the region.
1511130	1515030	Israel were due to play Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier
1515030	1517790	in Tel Aviv, but that game has been rescheduled.
1517890	1521030	And UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days
1521030	1524670	to see whether Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo
1524670	1527250	will still take place on the 15th of October.
1527870	1529030	To athletics news next,
1529350	1532910	Kenyan Kelvin Kiptun shattered the men's marathon world record
1532910	1536150	in Chicago. He beat his compatriot, Eli Kipchoga,
1536290	1538610	his previous one up by more than 30 seconds
1538610	1543090	on a 23-year-old finish in a time of two hours and 35 seconds.
1543570	1545970	And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup
1545970	1549110	despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal
1549110	1550990	in the final pool stage match.
1550990	1552750	Fiji got a losing bonus point
1552750	1555070	and they qualify at Australia's expense
1555070	1559010	due to their 22-15 victory way back in September.
1559730	1561030	Isaac, thank you very much indeed.
1561910	1565270	Now we are going to turn to Afghanistan
1565270	1568410	because thousands of people in the west of the country
1568410	1570890	are spending a second night in the open
1570890	1572970	after a strong earthquake on Saturday
1572970	1575210	reduced entire villages to rubble.
1575470	1577690	There's been confusion about the number of dead
1577690	1580950	with Taliban officials apologizing for an early assessment
1580950	1583910	that more than 2,000 people had died.
1584190	1586730	The United Nations humanitarian agency says
1586730	1589130	that more than 1,000 have been killed
1589130	1591330	and more than 500 are still missing.
1591870	1593810	I'm now joined by my colleague
1593810	1596270	from the Afghan Service, Angela Gehr.
1596470	1597710	Good morning to you, Angela.
1598210	1599930	What is the latest that you can tell us
1599930	1601610	about this devastating event?
1602910	1604070	Good morning.
1605090	1608710	The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan
1608710	1612050	is actually, I can say,
1612390	1615070	that is a very, very, very big...
1619190	1621930	the darkest time
1621930	1624510	that we are experiencing in Afghanistan.
1624770	1630330	The number that the Taliban are trying to share
1630330	1632210	with the media is very different
1632210	1636010	than what we have receiving from the people.
1636670	1638970	I think in that area,
1639350	1643830	we had more than 20 villages
1643830	1646390	which are completely destroyed
1648050	1649630	in the earthquake.
1651570	1655430	And also, there is no way for the...
1655430	1656810	Actually, in the first half,
1656930	1659110	the Taliban tried to control the medias.
1659110	1661070	We didn't receive...
1661070	1666550	Actually, we felt that everything is not that bad
1669790	1674970	when we sent the volunteers group to the area.
1675510	1678170	And actually, I'm so sorry.
1679150	1679950	No, don't worry.
1680190	1681110	And so, Angela, basically,
1681670	1684230	the Taliban have gone back to what they said.
1684310	1685310	The numbers have changed.
1685430	1687970	But what are people saying on the ground,
1687970	1689210	those who've been affected?
1690870	1694330	They don't accept the numbers
1694330	1696410	which the Taliban is sharing.
1697050	1699150	Actually, and also,
1700070	1703170	I think more than 2,000 people are killed.
1703970	1705650	1,000 people displaced.
1706830	1712170	And 1,000 people are missing in this crisis.
1712810	1716710	And we have nothing at that moment.
1716710	1720950	At this moment, there are no big, big
1720950	1725550	affair or support from the Taliban for the people.
1726290	1730710	Just the Red Cross and MSF
1731270	1733870	provided some help for the people
1733870	1737710	and the volunteers group from other cities.
1738570	1740390	Thank you so much for coming on to the program.
1740530	1742870	Telling us about the devastating earthquake
1742870	1745810	that has shaken Afghanistan in the west of the country.
