00:20.660 --> 00:29.500
This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza.

00:31.300 --> 00:37.420
The last couple of days were harrowing and the air strikes were very frequent and huge.

00:38.020 --> 00:44.960
Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with each and every missile very impactful and damaging.

00:45.600 --> 00:53.280
In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival, the first site attacked by Hamas.

00:53.280 --> 01:00.240
We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.

01:00.640 --> 01:05.760
And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000 people.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.860
Rescue efforts are continuing, but first we're getting a bulletin of world news.

01:13.550 --> 01:16.970
This is Danielle Yauvetska with the BBC News. Hello.

01:17.750 --> 01:25.490
The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over 500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

01:25.490 --> 01:35.650
Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel, two days after they carried out their devastating mass assault.

01:36.290 --> 01:40.110
More than 700 Israelis have been killed. John Donison is in Jerusalem.

01:40.890 --> 01:46.450
The Israeli military says it has continued to target Hamas infrastructure with air strikes overnight.

01:47.030 --> 01:54.470
The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced, with many seeking shelter in UN schools.

01:54.470 --> 02:03.720
But most believe this is just the beginning. Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000 army reservists.

02:04.530 --> 02:13.150
Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion, with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

02:13.850 --> 02:19.710
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far by Israeli air strikes.

02:19.710 --> 02:26.490
Over 2,000 people have been injured. They said power cuts were widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical workers.

02:26.870 --> 02:30.090
Hamas said it had fired a new barrage of missiles into Israel.

02:30.650 --> 02:36.610
Three U.S. air carriers as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates have suspended flights to Tel Aviv.

02:37.630 --> 02:41.730
The United States says it is sending immediate extra munitions to Israel.

02:41.730 --> 02:47.650
The Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier, to the eastern Mediterranean.

02:48.270 --> 02:50.450
More from Barbara Plattasha in Washington.

02:51.270 --> 02:57.790
The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.

02:58.210 --> 03:03.230
They're sending an aircraft carrier with a deck of warplanes, accompanied by cruisers and destroyers.

03:03.470 --> 03:06.010
Also, extra military assistance, such as munitions.

03:06.590 --> 03:11.230
In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the fight.

03:11.230 --> 03:14.830
It's backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas.

03:15.390 --> 03:19.070
There are reports that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack.

03:19.530 --> 03:23.950
Although the Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.

03:24.610 --> 03:30.050
The U.N. Security Council has held an emergency closed door session to discuss the crisis.

03:30.790 --> 03:35.910
The U.N. Middle East envoy called on countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.

03:35.910 --> 03:38.150
More from Netta Taufika, New York.

03:38.590 --> 03:41.730
Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement.

03:42.210 --> 03:44.050
Not all, but many condemned Hamas.

03:44.610 --> 03:52.410
The UAE's ambassador to the U.N., Lana Nasebe, told reporters there was real concern that tensions in the region could become inflamed.

03:52.790 --> 03:55.970
Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan,

03:56.390 --> 04:00.770
showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.

04:00.770 --> 04:08.650
The Palestinian U.N. ambassador, Riyad Mansour, told reporters he'd requested an emergency meeting of Arab League states in Cairo.

04:09.570 --> 04:11.130
BBC World News

04:12.330 --> 04:23.750
An independent inquiry in the U.K. will begin hearings today into allegations that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians including children in Afghanistan.

04:24.690 --> 04:29.590
The inquiry was set up by the British government after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.

04:30.590 --> 04:37.970
The U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to China, has met the foreign minister Wang Yi.

04:38.610 --> 04:44.130
Mr. Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.

04:45.530 --> 04:50.770
Regional elections in two of Germany's largest and wealthiest states, Bavaria and Hesse,

04:51.250 --> 04:55.070
have dealt a blow to the parties that form the center-left federal government.

04:55.070 --> 05:00.770
Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberal Free Democrats.

05:01.430 --> 05:04.030
The Christian Democrats again emerge as the largest party.

05:05.370 --> 05:09.850
The president of Ecuador has extended the state of emergency by 30 days.

05:10.210 --> 05:16.750
It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio.

05:17.310 --> 05:22.110
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were found dead in prison.

05:23.010 --> 05:30.070
A horde of coins believed to have belonged to a Highland clan chief who was murdered more than 300 years ago has been found in Scotland.

05:30.710 --> 05:32.110
Alexandra McKenzie reports.

05:32.990 --> 05:39.110
The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the first major excavation in Glencoe.

05:39.330 --> 05:44.550
The dig focused on scattered rocks believed to have been the McDonald's clan chief's summer house.

05:44.790 --> 05:48.270
More than 300 years after he died in the Glencoe massacre,

05:48.270 --> 05:53.210
an archaeology student taking part in her first ever dig found the horde.

05:53.530 --> 05:59.110
The University of Glasgow said the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins.

05:59.510 --> 06:05.210
A number of other artefacts were also discovered at the site, including a musket and fouling shot,

06:05.550 --> 06:08.430
pottery from across Europe and a powder major.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.330
BBC News.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.450
Thank you for that bulletin of news.

06:15.450 --> 06:19.870
Hello, you're with Newsday from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wohunder and Rob Young.

06:20.070 --> 06:24.430
Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue to focus on the conflict between Israel and Gaza

06:24.430 --> 06:29.950
with voices from both sides and that will get all your sports and business headlines to.

06:34.550 --> 06:42.110
We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.

06:42.110 --> 06:49.370
The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall with more than 2,000 injured.

06:49.690 --> 06:54.990
The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival

06:54.990 --> 06:59.550
attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.

06:59.990 --> 07:07.650
The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.

07:07.650 --> 07:16.590
In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2,000 wounded,

07:16.930 --> 07:19.820
according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.

07:20.810 --> 07:24.970
Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale distraction.

07:25.570 --> 07:30.730
Shops are closed, the streets are empty, the city is said to be like a ghost town.

07:31.130 --> 07:37.430
According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have not been displaced in Gaza

07:37.430 --> 07:43.010
because of the airstrikes and many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.

07:43.190 --> 07:46.310
In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.

07:47.050 --> 07:52.990
The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

07:53.550 --> 08:00.930
Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with very limited geographical area,

08:00.930 --> 08:07.250
like with over 2 million people living in 360 kilometers square,

08:07.910 --> 08:12.470
which make each and every missile dropped very impactful and damaging.

08:13.390 --> 08:20.390
The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing

08:20.840 --> 08:26.350
decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian land

08:26.350 --> 08:33.630
and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.

08:34.170 --> 08:44.150
Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal plocate on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians,

08:46.830 --> 08:54.170
refusing its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive

08:54.170 --> 09:03.270
and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison with restrictions on right to movement,

09:03.590 --> 09:07.130
right to health and many other associated basic rights.

09:07.510 --> 09:12.630
Yet we were told as civilians to leave, I mean, leave and go where.

09:13.630 --> 09:16.830
No crossings are open, neither the sea.

09:17.170 --> 09:19.590
That is also a restriction to some point.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.430
If you trespass, you can be shot.

09:22.430 --> 09:28.870
For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed, including women, children, elderly

09:28.870 --> 09:36.390
and persons with disabilities. I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school shelters

09:36.390 --> 09:44.390
that not even fully prepared or accommodate these numbers and provide for their needs.

09:45.070 --> 09:51.410
I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws and conflicts and its principles.

09:51.410 --> 09:57.770
These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and civilians,

09:58.190 --> 10:11.050
avoid disproportionate use of force and have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies

10:11.050 --> 10:25.710
for the population. And now there is limited electricity and crossings are fully closed to let any supplies.

10:26.650 --> 10:30.630
But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles.

10:31.250 --> 10:37.850
And the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.

10:38.670 --> 10:43.750
Our resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like.

10:43.770 --> 10:48.850
And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com for a slash news.

10:49.110 --> 10:52.370
There is a live page of being updated as we get more news.

10:52.530 --> 10:58.710
Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism.

10:58.890 --> 11:03.130
Former member of the Knessetli-Israeli parliament, Mikhail Kotler-Vunch.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.410
Thanks so much for joining us.

11:05.710 --> 11:06.870
Thank you so much for having me.

11:06.870 --> 11:09.070
How are Israelis feeling today?

11:10.350 --> 11:16.870
You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is...

11:17.410 --> 11:20.730
it actually encourages me to ask you the question.

11:20.970 --> 11:25.770
Because, you know, when I hear the framing of what is happening in Israel,

11:26.230 --> 11:34.950
where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in Gaza alongside all those civilians in Israel

11:34.950 --> 11:42.450
that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel,

11:42.890 --> 11:49.530
5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza,

11:49.990 --> 11:54.650
each rocket a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.

11:54.930 --> 12:01.810
When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260, at least,

12:01.810 --> 12:06.390
young party-goers on that very day of the holiday,

12:06.810 --> 12:12.310
when I think of the anti-Semitic terror organization, Hamas,

12:12.450 --> 12:19.550
actually designated as a terror organization funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran,

12:19.950 --> 12:27.050
holding its own civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza,

12:27.050 --> 12:31.930
in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West,

12:32.350 --> 12:39.610
that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.

12:40.010 --> 12:44.250
So I would turn the question to you, if this were happening anywhere else in the world,

12:44.510 --> 12:48.090
not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians,

12:48.410 --> 12:51.970
but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians,

12:51.970 --> 12:59.530
where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians

12:59.530 --> 13:08.070
and holding families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip,

13:08.290 --> 13:11.970
of entire families being butchered in their homes,

13:12.570 --> 13:20.370
and to hear the way that the framing that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel

13:20.370 --> 13:25.770
of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.

13:25.950 --> 13:33.730
Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives on this as we can.

13:33.930 --> 13:41.630
I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got a sense from you of the anger there is, and the sadness too.

13:41.830 --> 13:46.150
No, there is no anger. We are fighting for our lives. There is no anger. Let it be clear.

13:46.150 --> 13:54.410
You said that this is like Israel's 9-11. Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?

13:55.230 --> 13:59.570
It's not just because of this shock. It's because of the same modus operandi.

13:59.990 --> 14:06.590
This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us at the moment.

14:07.010 --> 14:13.490
Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that must defend its citizens from terror.

14:13.490 --> 14:19.950
You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand what Israelis are feeling.

14:20.230 --> 14:26.370
There is no both sides when a terror organization ravages civilian areas,

14:26.770 --> 14:31.410
enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians,

14:31.830 --> 14:38.450
breaking barriers that there is a fence. There has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.

14:39.270 --> 14:41.770
There has been a blockade, though, hasn't there, of Gaza?

14:41.930 --> 14:49.530
No, there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every day to work in Israel.

14:49.850 --> 14:54.830
There are thousands of truckloads. There is electricity and water still being supplied,

14:54.970 --> 14:58.750
although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza,

14:58.770 --> 15:02.470
because that's who was elected to reign over Gaza.

15:02.710 --> 15:05.510
And there is a responsibility of the international community

15:05.510 --> 15:08.830
and of all those that cherish life and liberty to hold Hamas

15:08.830 --> 15:14.930
to account for holding those 2 million civilians in Gaza hostage to their war crimes,

15:15.230 --> 15:17.730
not only on Israel, but on Gaza's civilians.

15:18.010 --> 15:20.210
How do you think the Israeli military should respond, then?

15:20.290 --> 15:25.470
We've seen, I've told, more than 500 airstrikes over the weekend.

15:25.490 --> 15:26.990
How do you think Israeli military should...

15:27.410 --> 15:29.970
Well, my job is to ask questions, not answer them.

15:30.350 --> 15:34.190
Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect its civilians

15:34.190 --> 15:39.890
when they're being attacked, including as we speak, in their homes, including as we speak.

15:40.010 --> 15:43.070
There is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror.

15:43.530 --> 15:46.130
This is not two countries fighting each other.

15:46.410 --> 15:52.070
A genocidal terror organization, ISIS, if you will, 9-11, needs moral clarity.

15:52.430 --> 15:56.310
And this is not just about Jews around the world who are now under attack.

15:56.310 --> 15:58.830
So to my question, how do you think the military should respond?

15:58.970 --> 16:03.110
There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza,

16:03.110 --> 16:09.830
although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment.

16:10.350 --> 16:13.950
Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government to go?

16:14.810 --> 16:20.350
There are dozens of Israeli hostages, and many of them are civilians that were abducted.

16:20.730 --> 16:26.010
Many of them raped. Many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated.

16:26.010 --> 16:32.890
And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must.

16:33.330 --> 16:36.710
The citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak.

16:37.350 --> 16:44.470
And every country that cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens

16:44.470 --> 16:49.470
from an ongoing onslaught, massacre of its civilians.

16:49.850 --> 16:53.930
And those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization.

16:53.930 --> 16:58.130
And I want to make it very clear, alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers

16:58.130 --> 17:01.930
and two civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization

17:01.930 --> 17:06.470
in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.

17:07.130 --> 17:10.230
And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries

17:10.230 --> 17:13.250
must call for the immediate and unconditional return

17:13.250 --> 17:18.230
because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas,

17:18.370 --> 17:23.430
a genocidal terror organization, to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.

17:23.430 --> 17:27.070
And what the IDF will have to do and the state of Israel will have to do

17:27.070 --> 17:30.410
in its existential war is not just about the state of Israel.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.370
I want to make it very clear to your listeners.

17:32.610 --> 17:35.550
Mikaela, Katla, Vunch, we've got to leave it there. Thanks for joining us.

17:36.290 --> 17:40.230
Well, staying with this story and looking at the business side of things.

17:40.410 --> 17:44.210
One industry that's already filling the impact of this conflict

17:44.210 --> 17:48.150
is the aviation industry with dozens of flights already canceled.

17:48.690 --> 17:51.990
Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore,

17:51.990 --> 17:54.430
Katie Silva. Katie, what are we seeing?

17:55.690 --> 17:58.850
Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines canceling flights.

17:59.050 --> 18:03.530
The likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair

18:03.530 --> 18:07.250
all canceled journeys. British Airways for its part told the BBC

18:07.250 --> 18:10.170
that it's only canceled one flight on Sunday

18:10.170 --> 18:13.970
and that it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days.

18:14.050 --> 18:17.070
And that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport

18:17.070 --> 18:20.270
or if perhaps they want to land at different times of the day

18:20.270 --> 18:21.450
that may be deemed safer.

18:22.110 --> 18:26.310
Many of these airlines are also offering passengers to cancel their flights

18:26.310 --> 18:29.410
or to move the dates with no sort of change fees.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.390
Flights to Israel's second international airport, Iliad,

18:33.590 --> 18:36.150
which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea, they've been unaffected.

18:36.410 --> 18:39.030
But we've also heard that Israelis flag carrier LL.

18:39.430 --> 18:42.410
It's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now

18:42.410 --> 18:47.390
but again allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.

18:47.390 --> 18:51.570
But this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying

18:51.570 --> 18:53.550
or desperately trying to leave.

18:54.950 --> 18:57.370
To leave as well as to get home.

18:57.530 --> 19:00.470
So that's one of the major issues is that many have found themselves stranded

19:00.470 --> 19:05.630
and with fears about whether or not the airspace will be closed.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.030
So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there amongst them

19:09.030 --> 19:12.550
stranded in Cyprus at Lanikah International Airport late last night.

19:13.370 --> 19:17.110
Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights.

19:17.110 --> 19:21.850
As I say, rumors about whether or not the country may close its airspace.

19:22.430 --> 19:23.930
It was hard to get tickets, we understand.

19:24.130 --> 19:27.990
Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights

19:27.990 --> 19:31.070
and getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.

19:31.530 --> 19:35.170
In terms of leaving the country, I've heard for example as well from Athens,

19:35.410 --> 19:37.850
the foreign ministry, saying that it's working to repatriate

19:37.850 --> 19:40.670
about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.

19:41.130 --> 19:44.610
Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece.

19:44.610 --> 19:49.650
But there is indeed much concern about many of the foreign workers in Israel.

19:49.830 --> 19:53.310
I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel.

19:53.570 --> 19:56.630
And so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home

19:56.630 --> 19:58.110
if indeed they want to leave Israel.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.870
All right, Katie Silva, it's a pleasure to have you on the program.

20:01.970 --> 20:04.170
Our business correspondent there in Singapore.

20:04.430 --> 20:06.890
And we are remaining with this story.

20:06.970 --> 20:11.010
And we are now going to speak to our international editor Jeremy Bowen.

20:11.150 --> 20:12.190
Good morning to you Jeremy.

20:12.190 --> 20:16.410
Now you have called this a major Middle East crisis.

20:16.850 --> 20:18.770
Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?

20:19.670 --> 20:26.230
Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas

20:26.230 --> 20:31.430
has been able to break out of Gaza, which is surrounded by,

20:31.490 --> 20:35.190
if you like, a ring of steel, of fences, wire fences and concrete.

20:35.850 --> 20:40.790
Break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis,

20:40.790 --> 20:42.610
including many, many civilians.

20:43.530 --> 20:47.410
That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before.

20:48.310 --> 20:53.110
And it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma

20:53.110 --> 20:58.470
and plenty of people here compare it to the 9-11 attacks in the United States.

20:59.030 --> 21:02.570
There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that

21:02.570 --> 21:04.870
if you adjust the death toll for population,

21:05.110 --> 21:09.570
it's equivalent of the Americans losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.

21:09.570 --> 21:13.270
So it's a big, big event.

21:13.650 --> 21:19.010
And the Israeli response, which is going to be, is already very heavy military action,

21:19.130 --> 21:22.510
but I think there'll be a land invasion, too, of Gaza.

21:23.390 --> 21:28.350
Now, that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region.

21:28.750 --> 21:32.090
So we're into really unexplored territory right now.

21:32.730 --> 21:36.710
And Jeremy, you have been in the region, you have been in the area.

21:36.710 --> 21:41.170
Just for our listeners' benefit, can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like

21:41.170 --> 21:43.550
and how that area is to Israel?

21:45.750 --> 21:52.010
Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast,

21:52.310 --> 21:54.810
which is surrounded mostly by Israel,

21:55.850 --> 22:01.450
but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.

22:03.490 --> 22:08.850
The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.

22:09.490 --> 22:13.790
Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes

22:13.790 --> 22:16.790
when Israel was created in 1948,

22:17.230 --> 22:20.650
a time that the Palestinians called the Nakba, the catastrophe.

22:21.670 --> 22:25.190
And it's an area where people are mostly very poor.

22:25.530 --> 22:28.810
They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.

22:28.810 --> 22:31.670
They're mostly not allowed to leave the area.

22:32.330 --> 22:35.670
There are plenty of adults there who've never left.

22:36.790 --> 22:42.710
And so it is a situation which is... life there is very hard

22:42.710 --> 22:45.730
and it's highly nationalistic and since 2007,

22:46.090 --> 22:49.850
it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas,

22:50.010 --> 22:53.570
which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement.

22:54.030 --> 22:57.810
And you wrote a nice read on our website

22:57.810 --> 23:00.690
where you said that Hamas blindsided Israel

23:00.690 --> 23:04.370
with what you called most the serious attack in a generation.

23:04.790 --> 23:07.730
And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken,

23:07.850 --> 23:09.870
including civilians as well as soldiers.

23:10.530 --> 23:12.530
What sort of challenge does this pose

23:12.530 --> 23:15.730
for the government of Mr. Netanyahu and the army going forward?

23:16.830 --> 23:19.750
It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government

23:19.750 --> 23:23.090
has, I think, faced probably for 50 years

23:23.090 --> 23:25.710
since the 1973 Middle East War.

23:28.310 --> 23:31.430
His political enemies are already blaming him,

23:31.590 --> 23:35.910
saying that he took his afterball for a variety of reasons.

23:36.590 --> 23:38.950
It's clear that there's been, from the Israeli perspective,

23:39.490 --> 23:40.930
a huge intelligence failure

23:40.930 --> 23:44.370
and they're struggling militarily to assert themselves.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.290
They will succeed in doing that.

23:46.390 --> 23:50.370
I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.970
I think the big question, which was...

23:53.970 --> 23:59.270
and this is probably an equal challenge for the Israelis,

23:59.890 --> 24:01.830
is what happens after that.

24:02.410 --> 24:04.250
How do they...

24:04.250 --> 24:07.410
what happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?

24:07.510 --> 24:10.470
Because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza

24:10.470 --> 24:13.790
and finally pulled out in 2005

24:15.310 --> 24:18.190
do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation.

24:18.210 --> 24:19.610
But if they sent in their troops,

24:20.470 --> 24:22.610
there's going to have to be some kind of governance

24:23.150 --> 24:25.970
of a territory which is maybe small,

24:26.090 --> 24:30.610
but, as I said, contains getting on for 2.5 million people.

24:31.990 --> 24:32.990
Jeremy Bowen there.

24:33.190 --> 24:34.390
Thank you for coming on the programme.

24:34.610 --> 24:36.110
He is our international editor.

24:43.210 --> 24:44.730
Going to move away from our top story.

24:44.930 --> 24:46.650
We will return to it later on in the programme, though.

24:46.990 --> 24:49.090
Isaac Fanon is here. He's going to give us some sports headlines.

24:49.350 --> 24:50.610
Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goes,

24:50.810 --> 24:53.810
but they finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League.

24:53.810 --> 24:56.390
Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th minute

24:56.390 --> 25:00.250
as City lost their second game in the Premier League in a row.

25:00.410 --> 25:02.470
It was the first time that's happened in five years.

25:02.910 --> 25:05.390
European football's governing body UEFA has postponed

25:05.390 --> 25:08.630
all matches scheduled in Israel during the next fortnight

25:08.630 --> 25:10.930
amid increased tensions in the region.

25:11.130 --> 25:15.030
Israel were due to play Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier

25:15.030 --> 25:17.790
in Tel Aviv, but that game has been rescheduled.

25:17.890 --> 25:21.030
And UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days

25:21.030 --> 25:24.670
to see whether Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo

25:24.670 --> 25:27.250
will still take place on the 15th of October.

25:27.870 --> 25:29.030
To athletics news next,

25:29.350 --> 25:32.910
Kenyan Kelvin Kiptun shattered the men's marathon world record

25:32.910 --> 25:36.150
in Chicago. He beat his compatriot, Eli Kipchoga,

25:36.290 --> 25:38.610
his previous one up by more than 30 seconds

25:38.610 --> 25:43.090
on a 23-year-old finish in a time of two hours and 35 seconds.

25:43.570 --> 25:45.970
And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup

25:45.970 --> 25:49.110
despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal

25:49.110 --> 25:50.990
in the final pool stage match.

25:50.990 --> 25:52.750
Fiji got a losing bonus point

25:52.750 --> 25:55.070
and they qualify at Australia's expense

25:55.070 --> 25:59.010
due to their 22-15 victory way back in September.

25:59.730 --> 26:01.030
Isaac, thank you very much indeed.

26:01.910 --> 26:05.270
Now we are going to turn to Afghanistan

26:05.270 --> 26:08.410
because thousands of people in the west of the country

26:08.410 --> 26:10.890
are spending a second night in the open

26:10.890 --> 26:12.970
after a strong earthquake on Saturday

26:12.970 --> 26:15.210
reduced entire villages to rubble.

26:15.470 --> 26:17.690
There's been confusion about the number of dead

26:17.690 --> 26:20.950
with Taliban officials apologizing for an early assessment

26:20.950 --> 26:23.910
that more than 2,000 people had died.

26:24.190 --> 26:26.730
The United Nations humanitarian agency says

26:26.730 --> 26:29.130
that more than 1,000 have been killed

26:29.130 --> 26:31.330
and more than 500 are still missing.

26:31.870 --> 26:33.810
I'm now joined by my colleague

26:33.810 --> 26:36.270
from the Afghan Service, Angela Gehr.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.710
Good morning to you, Angela.

26:38.210 --> 26:39.930
What is the latest that you can tell us

26:39.930 --> 26:41.610
about this devastating event?

26:42.910 --> 26:44.070
Good morning.

26:45.090 --> 26:48.710
The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan

26:48.710 --> 26:52.050
is actually, I can say,

26:52.390 --> 26:55.070
that is a very, very, very big...

26:59.190 --> 27:01.930
the darkest time

27:01.930 --> 27:04.510
that we are experiencing in Afghanistan.

27:04.770 --> 27:10.330
The number that the Taliban are trying to share

27:10.330 --> 27:12.210
with the media is very different

27:12.210 --> 27:16.010
than what we have receiving from the people.

27:16.670 --> 27:18.970
I think in that area,

27:19.350 --> 27:23.830
we had more than 20 villages

27:23.830 --> 27:26.390
which are completely destroyed

27:28.050 --> 27:29.630
in the earthquake.

27:31.570 --> 27:35.430
And also, there is no way for the...

27:35.430 --> 27:36.810
Actually, in the first half,

27:36.930 --> 27:39.110
the Taliban tried to control the medias.

27:39.110 --> 27:41.070
We didn't receive...

27:41.070 --> 27:46.550
Actually, we felt that everything is not that bad

27:49.790 --> 27:54.970
when we sent the volunteers group to the area.

27:55.510 --> 27:58.170
And actually, I'm so sorry.

27:59.150 --> 27:59.950
No, don't worry.

28:00.190 --> 28:01.110
And so, Angela, basically,

28:01.670 --> 28:04.230
the Taliban have gone back to what they said.

28:04.310 --> 28:05.310
The numbers have changed.

28:05.430 --> 28:07.970
But what are people saying on the ground,

28:07.970 --> 28:09.210
those who've been affected?

28:10.870 --> 28:14.330
They don't accept the numbers

28:14.330 --> 28:16.410
which the Taliban is sharing.

28:17.050 --> 28:19.150
Actually, and also,

28:20.070 --> 28:23.170
I think more than 2,000 people are killed.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.650
1,000 people displaced.

28:26.830 --> 28:32.170
And 1,000 people are missing in this crisis.

28:32.810 --> 28:36.710
And we have nothing at that moment.

28:36.710 --> 28:40.950
At this moment, there are no big, big

28:40.950 --> 28:45.550
affair or support from the Taliban for the people.

28:46.290 --> 28:50.710
Just the Red Cross and MSF

28:51.270 --> 28:53.870
provided some help for the people

28:53.870 --> 28:57.710
and the volunteers group from other cities.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.390
Thank you so much for coming on to the program.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.870
Telling us about the devastating earthquake

29:02.870 --> 29:05.810
that has shaken Afghanistan in the west of the country.

29:05.810 --> 29:08.770
This is Newsday on the BBC World Service with Robin Vick.
