00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:29,500
This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza.

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,420
The last couple of days were harrowing and the air strikes were very frequent and huge.

6
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,960
Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with each and every missile very impactful and damaging.

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,280
In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival, the first site attacked by Hamas.

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,240
We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that has been taken hostage by the Hamas militants.

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,760
And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan, where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000 people.

10
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,860
Rescue efforts are continuing, but first we're getting a bulletin of world news.

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,970
This is Danielle Yauvetska with the BBC News. Hello.

12
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:25,490
The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over 500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip.

13
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:35,650
Operations are continuing against Palestinian Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel, two days after they carried out their devastating mass assault.

14
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,110
More than 700 Israelis have been killed. John Donison is in Jerusalem.

15
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,450
The Israeli military says it has continued to target Hamas infrastructure with air strikes overnight.

16
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:54,470
The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced, with many seeking shelter in UN schools.

17
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:03,720
But most believe this is just the beginning. Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000 army reservists.

18
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:13,150
Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion, with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

19
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:19,710
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far by Israeli air strikes.

20
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:26,490
Over 2,000 people have been injured. They said power cuts were widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical workers.

21
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,090
Hamas said it had fired a new barrage of missiles into Israel.

22
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,610
Three U.S. air carriers as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates have suspended flights to Tel Aviv.

23
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,730
The United States says it is sending immediate extra munitions to Israel.

24
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,650
The Pentagon also announced it was deploying naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier, to the eastern Mediterranean.

25
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,450
More from Barbara Plattasha in Washington.

26
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,790
The large deployment underscores American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.

27
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,230
They're sending an aircraft carrier with a deck of warplanes, accompanied by cruisers and destroyers.

28
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,010
Also, extra military assistance, such as munitions.

29
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,230
In particular, they want to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the fight.

30
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,830
It's backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas.

31
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,070
There are reports that Iran helped organize the unprecedented attack.

32
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,950
Although the Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. hasn't seen evidence to confirm that.

33
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:30,050
The U.N. Security Council has held an emergency closed door session to discuss the crisis.

34
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,910
The U.N. Middle East envoy called on countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.

35
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,150
More from Netta Taufika, New York.

36
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,730
Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement.

37
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,050
Not all, but many condemned Hamas.

38
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:52,410
The UAE's ambassador to the U.N., Lana Nasebe, told reporters there was real concern that tensions in the region could become inflamed.

39
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,970
Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan,

40
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,770
showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.

41
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:08,650
The Palestinian U.N. ambassador, Riyad Mansour, told reporters he'd requested an emergency meeting of Arab League states in Cairo.

42
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,130
BBC World News

43
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:23,750
An independent inquiry in the U.K. will begin hearings today into allegations that British special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians including children in Afghanistan.

44
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,590
The inquiry was set up by the British government after legal action was brought by two Afghan families.

45
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,970
The U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to China, has met the foreign minister Wang Yi.

46
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,130
Mr. Schumer is the latest high-level American official to visit as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.

47
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,770
Regional elections in two of Germany's largest and wealthiest states, Bavaria and Hesse,

48
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,070
have dealt a blow to the parties that form the center-left federal government.

49
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,770
Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberal Free Democrats.

50
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,030
The Christian Democrats again emerge as the largest party.

51
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,850
The president of Ecuador has extended the state of emergency by 30 days.

52
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,750
It's been in place since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio.

53
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,110
The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over the killing were found dead in prison.

54
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:30,070
A horde of coins believed to have belonged to a Highland clan chief who was murdered more than 300 years ago has been found in Scotland.

55
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,110
Alexandra McKenzie reports.

56
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:39,110
The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the first major excavation in Glencoe.

57
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,550
The dig focused on scattered rocks believed to have been the McDonald's clan chief's summer house.

58
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,270
More than 300 years after he died in the Glencoe massacre,

59
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,210
an archaeology student taking part in her first ever dig found the horde.

60
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,110
The University of Glasgow said the discovery contained 36 silver and bronze coins.

61
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,210
A number of other artefacts were also discovered at the site, including a musket and fouling shot,

62
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,430
pottery from across Europe and a powder major.

63
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,330
BBC News.

64
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,450
Thank you for that bulletin of news.

65
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,870
Hello, you're with Newsday from the BBC World Service with Victoria Wohunder and Rob Young.

66
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,430
Coming up this half hour, we're going to continue to focus on the conflict between Israel and Gaza

67
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,950
with voices from both sides and that will get all your sports and business headlines to.

68
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:42,110
We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the numbers of those killed on both sides goes up by the hour.

69
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,370
The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have died in the attacks overall with more than 2,000 injured.

70
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,990
The rescuers say that they found 260 bodies at the site of a music festival

71
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,550
attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault on Saturday morning.

72
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,650
The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.

73
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:16,590
In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza Strip with more than 2,000 wounded,

74
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,820
according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.

75
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,970
Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale distraction.

76
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,730
Shops are closed, the streets are empty, the city is said to be like a ghost town.

77
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:37,430
According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have not been displaced in Gaza

78
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,010
because of the airstrikes and many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.

79
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,310
In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.

80
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,990
The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

81
00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:00,930
Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with very limited geographical area,

82
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,250
like with over 2 million people living in 360 kilometers square,

83
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,470
which make each and every missile dropped very impactful and damaging.

84
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:20,390
The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of the Israeli ongoing

85
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,350
decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian land

86
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:33,630
and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.

87
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:44,150
Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal plocate on Gaza for 17 years against Palestinians,

88
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:54,170
refusing its population access to basic supplies and material needs to survive

89
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:03,270
and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison with restrictions on right to movement,

90
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,130
right to health and many other associated basic rights.

91
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,630
Yet we were told as civilians to leave, I mean, leave and go where.

92
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,830
No crossings are open, neither the sea.

93
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,590
That is also a restriction to some point.

94
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,430
If you trespass, you can be shot.

95
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,870
For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed, including women, children, elderly

96
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:36,390
and persons with disabilities. I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school shelters

97
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:44,390
that not even fully prepared or accommodate these numbers and provide for their needs.

98
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:51,410
I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws and conflicts and its principles.

99
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:57,770
These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and civilians,

100
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:11,050
avoid disproportionate use of force and have responsibility for the humanitarian supplies

101
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:25,710
for the population. And now there is limited electricity and crossings are fully closed to let any supplies.

102
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,630
But in ground, all that is happening are against these principles.

103
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:37,850
And the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed and killing of civilians.

104
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,750
Our resident in Gaza there about what the last couple of days have been like.

105
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,850
And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com for a slash news.

106
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,370
There is a live page of being updated as we get more news.

107
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:58,710
Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for combating anti-Semitism.

108
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,130
Former member of the Knessetli-Israeli parliament, Mikhail Kotler-Vunch.

109
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,410
Thanks so much for joining us.

110
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,870
Thank you so much for having me.

111
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,070
How are Israelis feeling today?

112
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,870
You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is...

113
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,730
it actually encourages me to ask you the question.

114
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,770
Because, you know, when I hear the framing of what is happening in Israel,

115
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:34,950
where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in Gaza alongside all those civilians in Israel

116
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:42,450
that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel,

117
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:49,530
5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza,

118
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,650
each rocket a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.

119
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:01,810
When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260, at least,

120
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,390
young party-goers on that very day of the holiday,

121
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:12,310
when I think of the anti-Semitic terror organization, Hamas,

122
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:19,550
actually designated as a terror organization funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran,

123
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:27,050
holding its own civilians in Iran in the same way that Gaza,

124
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,930
in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11 was a wake-up call to the West,

125
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:39,610
that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.

126
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,250
So I would turn the question to you, if this were happening anywhere else in the world,

127
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,090
not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians,

128
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,970
but Israel's indeed responsibility to defend its civilians,

129
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:59,530
where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are indeed civilians

130
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:08,070
and holding families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza Strip,

131
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,970
of entire families being butchered in their homes,

132
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:20,370
and to hear the way that the framing that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel

133
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:25,770
of what enables genocidal terror to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.

134
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:33,730
Well, I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives on this as we can.

135
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:41,630
I asked you how Israelis were feeling, and I got a sense from you of the anger there is, and the sadness too.

136
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,150
No, there is no anger. We are fighting for our lives. There is no anger. Let it be clear.

137
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:54,410
You said that this is like Israel's 9-11. Is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?

138
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,570
It's not just because of this shock. It's because of the same modus operandi.

139
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:06,590
This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us at the moment.

140
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:13,490
Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that must defend its citizens from terror.

141
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,950
You cannot speak about both sides if you actually want to understand what Israelis are feeling.

142
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:26,370
There is no both sides when a terror organization ravages civilian areas,

143
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,410
enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those civilians,

144
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:38,450
breaking barriers that there is a fence. There has not been any occupation of Gaza since 2005.

145
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,770
There has been a blockade, though, hasn't there, of Gaza?

146
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:49,530
No, there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every day to work in Israel.

147
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,830
There are thousands of truckloads. There is electricity and water still being supplied,

148
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,750
although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza,

149
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,470
because that's who was elected to reign over Gaza.

150
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,510
And there is a responsibility of the international community

151
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,830
and of all those that cherish life and liberty to hold Hamas

152
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:14,930
to account for holding those 2 million civilians in Gaza hostage to their war crimes,

153
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,730
not only on Israel, but on Gaza's civilians.

154
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,210
How do you think the Israeli military should respond, then?

155
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,470
We've seen, I've told, more than 500 airstrikes over the weekend.

156
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,990
How do you think Israeli military should...

157
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,970
Well, my job is to ask questions, not answer them.

158
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,190
Well, I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect its civilians

159
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,890
when they're being attacked, including as we speak, in their homes, including as we speak.

160
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,070
There is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror.

161
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,130
This is not two countries fighting each other.

162
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,070
A genocidal terror organization, ISIS, if you will, 9-11, needs moral clarity.

163
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,310
And this is not just about Jews around the world who are now under attack.

164
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,830
So to my question, how do you think the military should respond?

165
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,110
There's been speculation there might be a ground invasion of Gaza,

166
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:09,830
although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza at the moment.

167
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,950
Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government to go?

168
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,350
There are dozens of Israeli hostages, and many of them are civilians that were abducted.

169
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:26,010
Many of them raped. Many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated.

170
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:32,890
And the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must.

171
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,710
The citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak.

172
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:44,470
And every country that cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens

173
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,470
from an ongoing onslaught, massacre of its civilians.

174
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,930
And those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror organization.

175
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,130
And I want to make it very clear, alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers

176
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,930
and two civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization

177
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,470
in a nine-year standing violation of international law and human rights.

178
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,230
And each one of those civilians and every one of our countries

179
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,250
must call for the immediate and unconditional return

180
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,230
because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas,

181
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,430
a genocidal terror organization, to hold those civilians hostage as we speak.

182
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,070
And what the IDF will have to do and the state of Israel will have to do

183
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,410
in its existential war is not just about the state of Israel.

184
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,370
I want to make it very clear to your listeners.

185
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,550
Mikaela, Katla, Vunch, we've got to leave it there. Thanks for joining us.

186
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,230
Well, staying with this story and looking at the business side of things.

187
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,210
One industry that's already filling the impact of this conflict

188
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,150
is the aviation industry with dozens of flights already canceled.

189
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,990
Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore,

190
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,430
Katie Silva. Katie, what are we seeing?

191
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,850
Well, yeah, as you mentioned, many airlines canceling flights.

192
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,530
The likes, for example, of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair

193
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,250
all canceled journeys. British Airways for its part told the BBC

194
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,170
that it's only canceled one flight on Sunday

195
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,970
and that it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days.

196
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,070
And that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport

197
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,270
or if perhaps they want to land at different times of the day

198
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,450
that may be deemed safer.

199
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,310
Many of these airlines are also offering passengers to cancel their flights

200
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,410
or to move the dates with no sort of change fees.

201
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,390
Flights to Israel's second international airport, Iliad,

202
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,150
which is a tourist destination on the Red Sea, they've been unaffected.

203
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,030
But we've also heard that Israelis flag carrier LL.

204
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,410
It's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now

205
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,390
but again allowing airlines and passengers to change their flights.

206
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,570
But this also comes at the same time as many Israelis are trying

207
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,550
or desperately trying to leave.

208
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,370
To leave as well as to get home.

209
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,470
So that's one of the major issues is that many have found themselves stranded

210
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,630
and with fears about whether or not the airspace will be closed.

211
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,030
So one of our reporters, for example, was actually there amongst them

212
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,550
stranded in Cyprus at Lanikah International Airport late last night.

213
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,110
Hundreds were packing in, hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights.

214
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,850
As I say, rumors about whether or not the country may close its airspace.

215
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,930
It was hard to get tickets, we understand.

216
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,990
Dozens were waiting to get the seats, for example, for no shows on the fully booked flights

217
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,070
and getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy.

218
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,170
In terms of leaving the country, I've heard for example as well from Athens,

219
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,850
the foreign ministry, saying that it's working to repatriate

220
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,670
about 149 Greek tourists from Israel.

221
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,610
Some of them were due to arrive back late last night into Greece.

222
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,650
But there is indeed much concern about many of the foreign workers in Israel.

223
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,310
I know, for example, Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel.

224
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,630
And so governments around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home

225
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,110
if indeed they want to leave Israel.

226
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,870
All right, Katie Silva, it's a pleasure to have you on the program.

227
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,170
Our business correspondent there in Singapore.

228
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,890
And we are remaining with this story.

229
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,010
And we are now going to speak to our international editor Jeremy Bowen.

230
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,190
Good morning to you Jeremy.

231
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,410
Now you have called this a major Middle East crisis.

232
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,770
Can you elaborate that for us, please, if you may?

233
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:26,230
Well, it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas

234
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,430
has been able to break out of Gaza, which is surrounded by,

235
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,190
if you like, a ring of steel, of fences, wire fences and concrete.

236
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:40,790
Break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis,

237
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,610
including many, many civilians.

238
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,410
That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before.

239
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:53,110
And it's becoming clear that it's a national trauma

240
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:58,470
and plenty of people here compare it to the 9-11 attacks in the United States.

241
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,570
There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that

242
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,870
if you adjust the death toll for population,

243
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,570
it's equivalent of the Americans losing more than 20,000 on 9-11.

244
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,270
So it's a big, big event.

245
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:19,010
And the Israeli response, which is going to be, is already very heavy military action,

246
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,510
but I think there'll be a land invasion, too, of Gaza.

247
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,350
Now, that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region.

248
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,090
So we're into really unexplored territory right now.

249
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,710
And Jeremy, you have been in the region, you have been in the area.

250
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,170
Just for our listeners' benefit, can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like

251
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,550
and how that area is to Israel?

252
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:52,010
Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast,

253
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,810
which is surrounded mostly by Israel,

254
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:01,450
but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt.

255
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,850
The Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people.

256
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,790
Many of them are descendants of families who lost their homes

257
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,790
when Israel was created in 1948,

258
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,650
a time that the Palestinians called the Nakba, the catastrophe.

259
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,190
And it's an area where people are mostly very poor.

260
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,810
They live in very difficult and cramped conditions.

261
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,670
They're mostly not allowed to leave the area.

262
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,670
There are plenty of adults there who've never left.

263
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:42,710
And so it is a situation which is... life there is very hard

264
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,730
and it's highly nationalistic and since 2007,

265
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,850
it's been controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas,

266
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,570
which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement.

267
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,810
And you wrote a nice read on our website

268
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,690
where you said that Hamas blindsided Israel

269
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,370
with what you called most the serious attack in a generation.

270
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,730
And we're hearing stories of hostages that have been taken,

271
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,870
including civilians as well as soldiers.

272
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,530
What sort of challenge does this pose

273
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,730
for the government of Mr. Netanyahu and the army going forward?

274
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,750
It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government

275
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,090
has, I think, faced probably for 50 years

276
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,710
since the 1973 Middle East War.

277
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,430
His political enemies are already blaming him,

278
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,910
saying that he took his afterball for a variety of reasons.

279
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,950
It's clear that there's been, from the Israeli perspective,

280
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,930
a huge intelligence failure

281
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,370
and they're struggling militarily to assert themselves.

282
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,290
They will succeed in doing that.

283
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,370
I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces.

284
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,970
I think the big question, which was...

285
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,270
and this is probably an equal challenge for the Israelis,

286
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,830
is what happens after that.

287
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,250
How do they...

288
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,410
what happens in Gaza on the day that they leave?

289
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,470
Because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza

290
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,790
and finally pulled out in 2005

291
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,190
do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation.

292
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,610
But if they sent in their troops,

293
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,610
there's going to have to be some kind of governance

294
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,970
of a territory which is maybe small,

295
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,610
but, as I said, contains getting on for 2.5 million people.

296
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,990
Jeremy Bowen there.

297
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,390
Thank you for coming on the programme.

298
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,110
He is our international editor.

299
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,730
Going to move away from our top story.

300
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,650
We will return to it later on in the programme, though.

301
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,090
Isaac Fanon is here. He's going to give us some sports headlines.

302
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,610
Yeah, it took Arsenal 12 goes,

303
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,810
but they finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League.

304
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,390
Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th minute

305
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,250
as City lost their second game in the Premier League in a row.

306
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,470
It was the first time that's happened in five years.

307
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,390
European football's governing body UEFA has postponed

308
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,630
all matches scheduled in Israel during the next fortnight

309
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,930
amid increased tensions in the region.

310
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,030
Israel were due to play Switzerland in a Euro 2024 qualifier

311
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,790
in Tel Aviv, but that game has been rescheduled.

312
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,030
And UEFA said it will assess the situation over the coming days

313
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,670
to see whether Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo

314
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,250
will still take place on the 15th of October.

315
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,030
To athletics news next,

316
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,910
Kenyan Kelvin Kiptun shattered the men's marathon world record

317
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,150
in Chicago. He beat his compatriot, Eli Kipchoga,

318
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,610
his previous one up by more than 30 seconds

319
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:43,090
on a 23-year-old finish in a time of two hours and 35 seconds.

320
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,970
And Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup

321
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,110
despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal

322
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,990
in the final pool stage match.

323
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,750
Fiji got a losing bonus point

324
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,070
and they qualify at Australia's expense

325
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,010
due to their 22-15 victory way back in September.

326
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,030
Isaac, thank you very much indeed.

327
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,270
Now we are going to turn to Afghanistan

328
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,410
because thousands of people in the west of the country

329
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,890
are spending a second night in the open

330
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,970
after a strong earthquake on Saturday

331
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,210
reduced entire villages to rubble.

332
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,690
There's been confusion about the number of dead

333
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,950
with Taliban officials apologizing for an early assessment

334
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,910
that more than 2,000 people had died.

335
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,730
The United Nations humanitarian agency says

336
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,130
that more than 1,000 have been killed

337
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,330
and more than 500 are still missing.

338
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,810
I'm now joined by my colleague

339
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,270
from the Afghan Service, Angela Gehr.

340
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,710
Good morning to you, Angela.

341
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,930
What is the latest that you can tell us

342
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,610
about this devastating event?

343
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,070
Good morning.

344
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,710
The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan

345
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,050
is actually, I can say,

346
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,070
that is a very, very, very big...

347
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,930
the darkest time

348
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,510
that we are experiencing in Afghanistan.

349
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:10,330
The number that the Taliban are trying to share

350
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,210
with the media is very different

351
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,010
than what we have receiving from the people.

352
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,970
I think in that area,

353
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:23,830
we had more than 20 villages

354
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,390
which are completely destroyed

355
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,630
in the earthquake.

356
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,430
And also, there is no way for the...

357
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,810
Actually, in the first half,

358
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,110
the Taliban tried to control the medias.

359
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,070
We didn't receive...

360
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,550
Actually, we felt that everything is not that bad

361
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:54,970
when we sent the volunteers group to the area.

362
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,170
And actually, I'm so sorry.

363
00:27:59,150 --> 00:27:59,950
No, don't worry.

364
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,110
And so, Angela, basically,

365
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,230
the Taliban have gone back to what they said.

366
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,310
The numbers have changed.

367
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,970
But what are people saying on the ground,

368
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,210
those who've been affected?

369
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,330
They don't accept the numbers

370
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,410
which the Taliban is sharing.

371
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,150
Actually, and also,

372
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,170
I think more than 2,000 people are killed.

373
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,650
1,000 people displaced.

374
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:32,170
And 1,000 people are missing in this crisis.

375
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,710
And we have nothing at that moment.

376
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,950
At this moment, there are no big, big

377
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,550
affair or support from the Taliban for the people.

378
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,710
Just the Red Cross and MSF

379
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,870
provided some help for the people

380
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,710
and the volunteers group from other cities.

381
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,390
Thank you so much for coming on to the program.

382
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,870
Telling us about the devastating earthquake

383
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,810
that has shaken Afghanistan in the west of the country.

384
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,770
This is Newsday on the BBC World Service with Robin Vick.
