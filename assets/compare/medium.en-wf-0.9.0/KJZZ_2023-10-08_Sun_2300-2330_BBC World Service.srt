00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:26,480
This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,540
more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza. We hear from a woman in Gaza.

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,500
The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,000
Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with each and every missile very impactful

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,580
and damaging. In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,240
at the site of a music festival, the first site attacked by Hamas.

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,060
We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that has been

11
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,340
taken hostage by the Hamas militants. And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan

12
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,860
where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000 people.

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,940
Rescue efforts are continuing. But first, we're getting a bulletin of world news.

14
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,730
This is Danielle Yawowieczka with the BBC News.

15
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,950
The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over

16
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,850
500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip. Operations are continuing against Palestinian

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,350
Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel, two days after they carried out their

18
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,410
devastating mass assault. More than 700 Israelis have been killed.

19
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,570
John Donison is in Jerusalem. The Israeli military says it has

20
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,490
continued to target Hamas infrastructure with airstrikes overnight.

21
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,830
The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced,

22
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:57,330
with many seeking shelter in UN schools. But most believe this is just the beginning.

23
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:03,470
Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000 army

24
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,810
reservists. Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion,

25
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:13,330
with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

26
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,670
Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far by

27
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,990
Israeli airstrikes. Over 2,000 people have been injured.

28
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,590
They said power cuts were widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical workers.

29
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,130
Hamas said it had fired a new barrage of missiles into Israel.

30
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,830
Three US air carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates,

31
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,790
have suspended flights to Tel Aviv. The United States says it's sending

32
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,010
immediate extra munitions to Israel. The Pentagon also announced it was deploying

33
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,710
naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier, to the eastern Mediterranean.

34
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,690
More from Barbara Platasha in Washington.

35
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,210
The UN Security Council has held an emergency closed-door session to discuss the crisis.

36
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,930
The UN Middle East envoy called on countries to exert diplomatic efforts to restore calm.

37
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,270
More from Neda Tawfiq in New York.

38
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,830
Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement.

39
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,450
Not all but many condemned Hamas. The UAE's ambassador to the UN,

40
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:52,510
told reporters there was real concern that tensions in the region could become inflamed.

41
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,110
Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan,

42
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,750
showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.

43
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,470
The Palestinian UN ambassador, Riyadh Mansour, told reporters he'd requested an emergency

44
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,210
meeting of Arab League states in Cairo. BBC World News

45
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,790
An independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into allegations that British

46
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,890
special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians, including children in Afghanistan.

47
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,190
The inquiry was set up by the British government after legal action was brought

48
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,710
by two Afghan families. The US Senate Majority Leader

49
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,150
Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to China,

50
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,390
has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Mr Schumer is the latest high-level

51
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,310
American official to visit as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.

52
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,830
Regional elections in two of Germany's largest and wealthiest states, Bavaria and Hesse,

53
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,150
have dealt a blow to the parties that form the center-left federal government.

54
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,090
Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens,

55
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:04,130
and the liberal Free Democrats. The Christian Democrats again emerge as the largest party.

56
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,970
The president of Ecuador has extended the state of emergency by 30 days. It's been in place

57
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,750
since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando

58
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,690
Villavicencio. The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over

59
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,230
the killing were found dead in prison. A hoard of coins believed to have belonged

60
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:30,270
to a Highland clan chief who was murdered more than 300 years ago has been found in Scotland.

61
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,310
Alexandra McKenzie reports.

62
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,450
The artifacts were also discovered at the site, including a musket and

63
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,470
fouling shot, pottery from across Europe, and a powder measure.

64
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,990
We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the numbers of those killed

65
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,730
on both sides goes up by the hour. The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have

66
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:52,150
died in the attacks overall, with more than 2,000 injured. The rescuers say that they found 260

67
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,570
bodies at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault

68
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,070
on Saturday morning. The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described

69
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,810
as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.

70
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,250
In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza

71
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:20,310
Strip, with more than 2,000 wounded, according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.

72
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,110
Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale destruction.

73
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:30,810
Shops are closed. The streets are empty. The city is said to be like a ghost town.

74
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:37,450
According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have now been displaced in Gaza

75
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:43,010
because of the airstrikes, and many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.

76
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,530
In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.

77
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:53,110
The last couple of days were harrowing, and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.

78
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:59,190
Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with very limited geographical

79
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:07,330
area, like with over 2 million people living in 360-kilometer squares,

80
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,550
which make each and every missile dropped very impactful and damaging.

81
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,630
The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of

82
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,790
the Israeli ongoing, decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian

83
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:32,930
land, and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of

84
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:43,170
apartheid. Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17 years against

85
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:52,010
Palestinians, refusing its population access to basic supplies and material

86
00:08:52,530 --> 00:09:02,550
needs to survive, and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison, with restrictions on

87
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,190
right to movement, right to health, and many other associated basic rights.

88
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:15,210
Yet we were told as civilians to leave. I mean, leave and go where. No crossings are open,

89
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:22,490
neither the sea. There is also a restriction to some point, if you trespass, you can be shot.

90
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,990
For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed, including women, children, elderly,

91
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:35,890
and persons with disabilities. I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school

92
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:42,850
shelters that are not even fully prepared or equipped to accommodate these numbers and provide

93
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:50,030
for their needs. I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws in conflict

94
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:57,420
and its principles. These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and

95
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:09,880
surveillance, avoid disproportionate use of force, and have responsibility for the humanitarian

96
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:22,920
supplies for the population. And now there is limited electricity and crossings are fully

97
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,800
closed to let in any supplies. But on the ground, all that is happening are against

98
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,740
these principles. And the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed

99
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:42,600
and killing of civilians. Our resident in Gaza, they are about what the last couple of days

100
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,700
have been like. And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com

101
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,440
news. There is our live page being updated as we get more news.

102
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,280
Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for

103
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,960
combating anti-Semitism, a former member of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament,

104
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,140
Mikhail Kotlovich. Thanks so much for joining us. How are Israelis feeling today?

105
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,920
You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is

106
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,480
it actually encourages me to ask you the question because, you know, when I hear the framing of what

107
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,980
is happening in Israel, where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in Gaza

108
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,240
alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were

109
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,580
in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel,

110
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:49,580
5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza,

111
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,700
each rocket a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.

112
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:02,640
When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260 at least young

113
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:09,180
party goers on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the anti-Semitic

114
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,820
terror organization, Hamas, actually designated as a terror organization,

115
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:25,120
funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran, holding its own civilians in Iran

116
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,760
in the same way that Gaza, in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11

117
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,340
was a wake-up call to the West, that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way

118
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,740
that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.

119
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,320
So I would turn the question to you if this were happening anywhere else in the world,

120
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:50,500
not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians, but Israel's indeed responsibility

121
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:58,000
to defend its civilians, where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are

122
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:07,640
indeed civilians in a holding of families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza

123
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:15,460
Strip, of entire families being butchered in their homes, and to hear the way that the framing

124
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:22,640
that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel of what enables genocidal terror

125
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,780
to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.

126
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:32,620
Well I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives

127
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,140
on this as we can. I asked you how Israelis were feeling and I got a sense from you of the

128
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,320
of the the anger there is and the sadness.

129
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,160
No there is no anger, we are fighting for our lives, there is no anger, let it be clear.

130
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:54,500
You said that this is like Israel's 9-11, is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?

131
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,640
It's not just because of this shock, it's because of the same modus operandi.

132
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,000
This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us

133
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,080
at the moment. Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that

134
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:17,560
must defend its citizens from terror. You cannot speak about both sides if you actually

135
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,300
want to understand what Israelis are feeling. There is no both sides when a terror organization

136
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:30,780
ravages civilian areas, enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those

137
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:37,340
civilians, breaking barriers, that there is a fence, there has not been any occupation of Gaza since

138
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,840
2005 and the voices that you are listening to. There has been a blockade though hasn't there of Gaza?

139
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,460
No there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every day

140
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,880
to work in Israel. There are thousands of truckloads, there is electricity and water

141
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,780
still being supplied although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza

142
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:04,380
because that's who was elected to reign over Gaza and there is a responsibility of the

143
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:09,480
international community and of all those that cherish life and liberty to hold Hamas to account

144
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:16,300
for holding those two million civilians in Gaza hostage to their war crimes not only on Israel

145
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,820
but on Gaza's civilians. How do you think the Israeli military should respond then? We've seen

146
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:26,440
they're told more than 500 airstrikes over the weekend. How do you think the Israeli military

147
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,320
should, how do you think any other country should respond? Well my job is to ask questions

148
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,660
not answer them. Well I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect

149
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,660
its civilians when they're being attacked including as we speak in their homes including as we

150
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,060
speak. There is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror. This is not two countries

151
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,540
fighting each other. A genocidal terror organization ISIS if you will 9-11 has needs moral

152
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,780
clarity and this is not just about Jews around the world who are now under attack. To my

153
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,140
question and how do you think the military should respond there's been speculation there

154
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:08,300
might be a ground invasion of Gaza although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in

155
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,580
Gaza at the moment. Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government

156
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:20,240
to go? There are dozens of Israeli hostages and many of them are civilians that were abducted,

157
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,180
many of them raped, many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated

158
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:33,060
and the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must

159
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:39,580
the citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak and every country that

160
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:48,700
cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught massacre of

161
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,500
its civilians and those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror

162
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,800
organization and I want to make it very clear alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers and two

163
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,480
civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization in a nine-year

164
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,660
standing violation of international law and human rights and each one of those civilians

165
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,260
and every one of our countries must call for the immediate and unconditional return

166
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,000
because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization,

167
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,180
to hold those civilians hostage as we speak and what the IDF will have to do and the state

168
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,740
of Israel will have to do in its existential war is not just about the state of Israel I want

169
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,780
to make it very clear to your listeners. Michaela, we've got to leave it there thanks for joining us.

170
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,760
Well same with this story and looking at the business side of things one industry that's already

171
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,680
feeling the impact of this conflict is the aviation industry with dozens of flights already

172
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,920
cancelled. Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore, Ketty Silva.

173
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,100
Ketty what are we seeing? Well yeah as you mentioned many airlines cancelling flights the

174
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,400
likes for example of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair all cancel

175
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,140
journeys. British Airways for its part told the BBC that it's only cancelled one flight

176
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,020
on Sunday and it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days

177
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,340
and that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport or if perhaps they want

178
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,120
to land at different times of the day that may be deemed safer. Many of these airlines are

179
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,120
also offering passengers to to cancel their flights or to move the dates with no sort of change

180
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,780
fees. Flights to Israel's second international airport Iliad which is a tourist destination on

181
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,080
the Red Sea they've been unaffected but we've also heard that Israelis flag carrier El Al

182
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,700
it's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now but again allowing

183
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,560
airlines and passengers to change their flights. But Ketty this also comes at the same

184
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:57,060
time as many Israelis are trying or desperately trying to leave. Oh to leave as well as to get

185
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,600
home. So that's one of the major issues is that many have found themselves stranded and with fears

186
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,480
about whether or not the airspace will be closed. So one of our reporters for example

187
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,740
was actually there amongst them stranded in Cyprus, Atlantica International Airport late last night.

188
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,580
Hundreds were packing in hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights home.

189
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,060
As I say rumors about whether or not the country may close its airspace. It was hard to get

190
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,540
tickets we understand. Dozens were waiting to get the seats for example for no shows on the fully

191
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,380
booked flights and getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy. In terms of leaving

192
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,420
the country we've heard for example as well from Athens the foreign ministry is saying that

193
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:42,620
it's working to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel. Some of them were due to arrive

194
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,600
back late last night into Greece but there is indeed much concern about many of the the

195
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,120
workers in Israel. I know for example Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel and so governments

196
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,200
around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home if indeed they want to leave Israel.

197
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,120
All right Katie, it's always a pleasure to have you on the program our business correspondent

198
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,440
there in Singapore and we are remaining with this story and we are now going to speak to

199
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,960
our international editor Jeremy Bowen. Good morning to you Jeremy. Now you have called this

200
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,860
a major Middle East crisis. Can you elaborate that for us please if you may?

201
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:28,980
Well it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas has been able to break out of

202
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:35,320
Gaza which is surrounded by if you like a ring of steel of fences wire fences and concrete

203
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:42,720
break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis including many many civilians.

204
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:51,440
That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before and it's becoming clear that

205
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,960
it's a national trauma and plenty of people here compare it to the 9-11 attacks in the United

206
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,380
States. There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that if you adjust the

207
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:08,320
death toll for population it's equivalent to the Americans losing more than 20,000

208
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:16,240
on 9-11. So it's a big big event and the Israeli response which is going to be

209
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,660
is already very heavy military action but they think there'll be a land invasion too of Gaza.

210
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,280
Now that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region so we're

211
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,840
into really unexplored territory right now. And Jeremy you have been in the region you have

212
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,260
been in the area just for our listeners benefit can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like

213
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,780
and how that area is to Israel?

214
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:54,060
Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast which is surrounded mostly

215
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:03,440
by Israel but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt. The

216
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:11,500
the Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people. Many of them are descendants of

217
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,680
families who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948, a time that the Palestinians

218
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:25,360
call the Nakba, the catastrophe. And it's an area where people are mostly very poor,

219
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:31,760
they live in very difficult and cramped conditions, they're mostly not allowed to leave the area.

220
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:40,470
There are plenty of adults there who've never left and so it's some it is a situation which is

221
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,280
life there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic and since 2007 it's been controlled

222
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,180
by the Palestinian militant group Hamas which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic resistance

223
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:59,420
movement. And you wrote a nice read on our website where you said that you know Hamas

224
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:05,460
blindsided Israel with what you called most serious attack in a generation and we're hearing

225
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,040
stories of hostages that have been taken including civilians as well as soldiers.

226
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,360
What sort of challenge does this pose for the government of Mr Netanyahu and the army going

227
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,220
forward? It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government has I think faced

228
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,840
probably for 50 years since the 1973 Middle East war.

229
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:34,620
He is his political enemies are already blaming him saying that he took his eye off the ball for

230
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,880
a variety of reasons. It's clear that there's been from the Israeli perspective a huge

231
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,160
intelligence failure and they're struggling militarily to assert themselves they will

232
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,580
succeed in doing that. I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces

233
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:57,900
I think the big question which was and this is that probably an equal challenge

234
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,500
for the Israelis is what happens after that how do they what happens in Gaza

235
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:12,800
on the day that they leave because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza and finally pulled out in

236
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:19,720
2005 do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation but if they sent in their troops

237
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,560
there's going to have to be some kind of governance of a territory which is maybe

238
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,780
small but as I said contains getting on for two and a half million people.

239
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,260
Jeremy Bowen there thank you for coming on the program he is our international editor.

240
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,440
We're going to move away from our top story we will return to it later on in the program

241
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,200
though and Isaac Fanon is here he's going to give us some sports headlines.

242
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,800
Yeah took Arsenal 12 goes but they finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League.

243
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,140
Gabriel Martinelli scoring the only goal in the 86th minute as City lost

244
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:02,540
their second game in the Premier League in a row for the first time that's happened in five years.

245
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,800
European football's governing body UEFA has postponed all matches scheduled in Israel during

246
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,260
the next fortnight amid increased tensions in the region. Israel were due to play Switzerland in

247
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,700
a Euro 2024 qualifier in Tel Aviv but that game has been rescheduled and UEFA said it will

248
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,700
assess the situation over the coming days to see whether Israel's away qualifier in Kosovo

249
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,600
will still take place on the 15th of October. To athletics news next Kenyan Kelvin Kipton

250
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,500
shattered the men's marathon world record in Chicago. He beat his compatriot Eli Kipchoge's

251
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:43,220
previous one by more than 30 seconds and 23 year old finished in a time of 2 hours 35 seconds

252
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:49,800
and Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup despite Fiji losing 24-23 to Portugal in the

253
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,160
final pool stage match. Fiji got a losing bonus point and they qualify at Australia's expense

254
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:01,140
due to their 22-15 victory way back in September. Isaac thank you very much indeed.

255
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,460
Now we are going to turn to Afghanistan because thousands of people in the west of the country

256
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,240
are spending a second night in the open after a strong earthquake on Saturday reduced entire

257
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,920
villages to rubble. There's been confusion about the number of dead with Taliban officials

258
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:25,040
apologizing for an early assessment that more than 2,000 people had died. The United Nations

259
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,040
humanitarian agency says that more than 1,000 have been killed and more than 500 are still

260
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:37,220
missing. I'm now joined by my colleague from the Afghan service Angela Gehr. Good morning to

261
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,740
Angela. What is the latest that you can tell us about this devastating event?

262
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:52,180
Good morning. The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is actually I can say

263
00:26:52,180 --> 00:27:03,860
that is a very very very big the the the darkest time that we are experiencing in

264
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:12,300
Afghanistan. The number that the Taliban are trying to share with the media is very different

265
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:20,940
what we we have receiving from the people. I think in that area we have we had

266
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:32,300
more than 20 violence which are completely destroyed in the earthquake and also

267
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:39,180
there is no way for the actually in the first half where Taliban tried to control the medias

268
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:47,060
we didn't receive there actually we thought that everything is not that that bad what

269
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:55,900
what we we when when we we sent the volunteers group to to the area and and

270
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:03,360
actually I'm so sorry I'm no don't worry and so Angela basically the the the Taliban have gone

271
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,400
back to what they said the numbers have changed but what are people saying on the ground those

272
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:17,800
who've been affected they don't accept the numbers which the Taliban is sharing actually

273
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:25,980
and also I think more than 2 000 people are killed a thousand people displaced

274
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:36,360
and and thousand people are missed in missing in this crisis and we we have nothing at that

275
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:45,260
moment at this moment there are no no big big affair or support from from the Taliban for the

276
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:55,020
people just that just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help for the people and and

277
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,440
the volunteers group from Angela and other cities thank you so much for coming on to the program

278
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,880
telling us about the devastating earthquake that has shaken Afghanistan in the west of the country
