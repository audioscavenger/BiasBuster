17180	26480	This morning, we're hearing at least 700 people are killed on the Israeli side with
26480	31540	more than 400 Palestinians dead in Gaza. We hear from a woman in Gaza.
31860	37500	The last couple of days were harrowing and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.
38300	44000	Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with each and every missile very impactful
44000	49580	and damaging. In Israel, rescuers say they found 260 bodies
49580	53240	at the site of a music festival, the first site attacked by Hamas.
53240	58060	We'll bring you the story of one family that is looking for their loved ones that has been
58060	62340	taken hostage by the Hamas militants. And in other news, we'll go to Afghanistan
62340	65860	where an earthquake has killed more than 2,000 people.
66060	69940	Rescue efforts are continuing. But first, we're getting a bulletin of world news.
73810	76730	This is Danielle Yawowieczka with the BBC News.
77590	82950	The Israeli military says its fighter jets, helicopters and artillery have struck over
82950	88850	500 targets overnight in the Gaza Strip. Operations are continuing against Palestinian
88850	94350	Hamas militants in several locations inside Israel, two days after they carried out their
94350	98410	devastating mass assault. More than 700 Israelis have been killed.
98850	102570	John Donison is in Jerusalem. The Israeli military says it has
102570	106490	continued to target Hamas infrastructure with airstrikes overnight.
107110	111830	The United Nations says more than 120,000 Gazans have now been displaced,
111830	117330	with many seeking shelter in UN schools. But most believe this is just the beginning.
117910	123470	Israel is massing its forces around Gaza and says it has called up around 100,000 army
123470	127810	reservists. Palestinians are bracing themselves for a possible ground invasion,
128290	133330	with Israel saying its aim is to rescue hostages and remove Hamas from power in Gaza.
133970	138670	Health officials in Gaza say more than 400 Palestinians have been killed so far by
138670	141990	Israeli airstrikes. Over 2,000 people have been injured.
142550	146590	They said power cuts were widespread and were posing a major challenge for medical workers.
147010	150130	Hamas said it had fired a new barrage of missiles into Israel.
150730	154830	Three US air carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates,
155010	159790	have suspended flights to Tel Aviv. The United States says it's sending
159790	164010	immediate extra munitions to Israel. The Pentagon also announced it was deploying
164010	167710	naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier, to the eastern Mediterranean.
167710	170690	More from Barbara Platasha in Washington.

218730	221830	Council members did not attempt to reach agreement on a statement.
222290	226450	Not all but many condemned Hamas. The UAE's ambassador to the UN,
226450	232510	told reporters there was real concern that tensions in the region could become inflamed.
232830	236110	Before the meeting, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan,
236430	240750	showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.
241190	246470	The Palestinian UN ambassador, Riyadh Mansour, told reporters he'd requested an emergency
246470	251210	meeting of Arab League states in Cairo. BBC World News
252430	258790	An independent inquiry in the UK will begin hearings today into allegations that British
258790	263890	special forces killed dozens of unarmed civilians, including children in Afghanistan.
264810	268190	The inquiry was set up by the British government after legal action was brought
268190	272710	by two Afghan families. The US Senate Majority Leader
272710	276150	Chuck Schumer, who's leading a bipartisan delegation to China,
276150	280390	has met the Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Mr Schumer is the latest high-level

291350	295150	have dealt a blow to the parties that form the center-left federal government.
295750	299090	Provisional results show losses for the Social Democrats, the Greens,
299390	304130	and the liberal Free Democrats. The Christian Democrats again emerge as the largest party.
304970	310970	The president of Ecuador has extended the state of emergency by 30 days. It's been in place
310970	315750	since the assassination in August of the anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando
315750	320690	Villavicencio. The extension comes just days after seven Colombians arrested over
320690	325230	the killing were found dead in prison. A hoard of coins believed to have belonged
325230	330270	to a Highland clan chief who was murdered more than 300 years ago has been found in Scotland.
330270	332310	Alexandra McKenzie reports.
360270	364450	The artifacts were also discovered at the site, including a musket and
364450	368470	fouling shot, pottery from across Europe, and a powder measure.
394510	399990	We are starting with the latest development in Israel and Gaza as the numbers of those killed
399990	405730	on both sides goes up by the hour. The Israeli military says that at least 700 people have
405730	412150	died in the attacks overall, with more than 2,000 injured. The rescuers say that they found 260
412710	418570	bodies at the site of a music festival attacked by Hamas militants in the unprecedented assault
418570	424070	on Saturday morning. The wave of attacks launched by the Hamas militant group is being described
424070	427810	as the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.
428310	434250	In retaliation, Israel launched airstrikes that have killed at least 400 people in the Gaza
434250	440310	Strip, with more than 2,000 wounded, according to the latest update from the Palestinian officials.
440910	445110	Video images show many buildings being blown up in large-scale destruction.
445110	450810	Shops are closed. The streets are empty. The city is said to be like a ghost town.
451350	457450	According to the United Nations, 123,000 Palestinians have now been displaced in Gaza
457450	463010	because of the airstrikes, and many Palestinians say they are now living in fear of their lives.
463150	466530	In the last hour, we got this voice note from a resident in Gaza.
467250	473110	The last couple of days were harrowing, and the airstrikes were very frequent and huge.
473670	479190	Gaza is a very highly dense populated area with very limited geographical
480530	487330	area, like with over 2 million people living in 360-kilometer squares,
487970	492550	which make each and every missile dropped very impactful and damaging.
493510	498630	The offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of
498970	505790	the Israeli ongoing, decades-long military occupation and settler colonization of Palestinian
505790	512930	land, and the imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of
512930	523170	apartheid. Meanwhile, Israel also has maintained a brutal blockade on Gaza for 17 years against
523170	532010	Palestinians, refusing its population access to basic supplies and material
532530	542550	needs to survive, and trapping them in amounts to an open-air prison, with restrictions on
542550	547190	right to movement, right to health, and many other associated basic rights.
547190	555210	Yet we were told as civilians to leave. I mean, leave and go where. No crossings are open,
555410	562490	neither the sea. There is also a restriction to some point, if you trespass, you can be shot.
562790	568990	For the last few days, hundreds of Palestinians were killed, including women, children, elderly,
569270	575890	and persons with disabilities. I mean, thousands of people are internally displaced to school
575890	582850	shelters that are not even fully prepared or equipped to accommodate these numbers and provide
583300	590030	for their needs. I mean, Israel has to adhere to the international humanitarian laws in conflict
590030	597420	and its principles. These principles require Israel to respect the distinction between competence and
597420	609880	surveillance, avoid disproportionate use of force, and have responsibility for the humanitarian
610620	622920	supplies for the population. And now there is limited electricity and crossings are fully
622920	629800	closed to let in any supplies. But on the ground, all that is happening are against
629800	635740	these principles. And the international community has to play a role in ending this bloodshed
635740	642600	and killing of civilians. Our resident in Gaza, they are about what the last couple of days
642600	647700	have been like. And if you want to keep up to date with the latest, just go to bbc.com
647700	652440	news. There is our live page being updated as we get more news.
652960	657280	Well, we're going to head to Israel and speak to the country's special envoy for
657280	661960	combating anti-Semitism, a former member of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament,
662240	669140	Mikhail Kotlovich. Thanks so much for joining us. How are Israelis feeling today?
670920	676920	You know, I think that what you just actually framed as how Israelis are feeling is
677700	684480	it actually encourages me to ask you the question because, you know, when I hear the framing of what
684480	691980	is happening in Israel, where a genocidal terror organization holding two million civilians in Gaza
691980	698240	alongside all those civilians in Israel that were targeted on Saturday morning as we were
698240	702580	in our synagogues on a Sabbath morning and a holiday in Israel,
702580	709580	5,000 rockets launched at Israeli civilians from densely populated areas in Gaza,
709980	714700	each rocket a double war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law.
715040	722640	When I think of the massacre targeting Jews that indiscriminately shot 260 at least young
723620	729180	party goers on that very day of the holiday, when I think of the anti-Semitic
730220	735820	terror organization, Hamas, actually designated as a terror organization,
736020	745120	funded and supported by a genocidal regime in Iran, holding its own civilians in Iran
745800	749760	in the same way that Gaza, in the same way that ISIS, in the same way that 9-11
749760	756340	was a wake-up call to the West, that genocidal terror cannot be allowed to dictate the way
756340	759740	that sovereign democratic countries conduct ourselves.
760060	764320	So I would turn the question to you if this were happening anywhere else in the world,
764460	770500	not only for Israel's right to defend its civilians, but Israel's indeed responsibility
770500	778000	to defend its civilians, where the majority of those targeted over the last 48 hours are
778000	787640	indeed civilians in a holding of families of Holocaust survivors being abducted into the Gaza
787640	795460	Strip, of entire families being butchered in their homes, and to hear the way that the framing
795460	802640	that BBC enables this situation is actually part and parcel of what enables genocidal terror
802640	805780	to control and to continue to dictate the discourse.
805780	812620	Well I think you'll find that we're talking to as many different people with as many perspectives
812620	818140	on this as we can. I asked you how Israelis were feeling and I got a sense from you of the
818140	821320	of the the anger there is and the sadness.
821400	826160	No there is no anger, we are fighting for our lives, there is no anger, let it be clear.
826940	834500	You said that this is like Israel's 9-11, is that because of the shock that this was able to happen?
835220	839640	It's not just because of this shock, it's because of the same modus operandi.
840340	846000	This is a terror organization listed as such in most of the countries that are listening to us
846000	851080	at the moment. Terror is not a moral equivalency to a sovereign country that
851080	857560	must defend its citizens from terror. You cannot speak about both sides if you actually
857560	863300	want to understand what Israelis are feeling. There is no both sides when a terror organization
864400	870780	ravages civilian areas, enters under the guise of 5,000 rockets targeting those
870780	877340	civilians, breaking barriers, that there is a fence, there has not been any occupation of Gaza since
877340	881840	2005 and the voices that you are listening to. There has been a blockade though hasn't there of Gaza?
881920	888460	No there is no blockade because there are thousands, thousands of workers entering Gaza every day
888460	893880	to work in Israel. There are thousands of truckloads, there is electricity and water
893880	898780	still being supplied although Hamas has responsibility for the civilians in Gaza
898780	904380	because that's who was elected to reign over Gaza and there is a responsibility of the
904380	909480	international community and of all those that cherish life and liberty to hold Hamas to account
909480	916300	for holding those two million civilians in Gaza hostage to their war crimes not only on Israel
916300	920820	but on Gaza's civilians. How do you think the Israeli military should respond then? We've seen
920820	926440	they're told more than 500 airstrikes over the weekend. How do you think the Israeli military
926440	929320	should, how do you think any other country should respond? Well my job is to ask questions
929320	933660	not answer them. Well I'm wondering what you think any country must do in order to protect
933660	939660	its civilians when they're being attacked including as we speak in their homes including as we
939660	945060	speak. There is an ongoing war here with genocidal terror. This is not two countries
945060	951540	fighting each other. A genocidal terror organization ISIS if you will 9-11 has needs moral
951540	956780	clarity and this is not just about Jews around the world who are now under attack. To my
956780	960140	question and how do you think the military should respond there's been speculation there
960140	968300	might be a ground invasion of Gaza although we're told there are dozens of Israeli hostages in
968300	973580	Gaza at the moment. Do you think a ground invasion is the way for the Israeli government
973580	980240	to go? There are dozens of Israeli hostages and many of them are civilians that were abducted,
980980	986180	many of them raped, many of them paraded around the streets of Gaza and celebrated
986780	993060	and the Israeli IDF will do everything that it needs to do to protect as it must
993060	999580	the citizens of the state of Israel under attack as we speak and every country that
999580	1008700	cherishes life and liberty must protect its citizens from an ongoing onslaught massacre of
1008700	1013500	its civilians and those hostages that have been held are being held by a genocidal terror
1013500	1018800	organization and I want to make it very clear alongside two Israeli deceased soldiers and two
1018800	1023480	civilians that have been held by the same genocidal terror organization in a nine-year
1023480	1028660	standing violation of international law and human rights and each one of those civilians
1028660	1033260	and every one of our countries must call for the immediate and unconditional return
1033260	1040000	because it is countries supporting Gaza and enabling Hamas, a genocidal terror organization,
1040020	1046180	to hold those civilians hostage as we speak and what the IDF will have to do and the state
1046180	1050740	of Israel will have to do in its existential war is not just about the state of Israel I want
1050740	1055780	to make it very clear to your listeners. Michaela, we've got to leave it there thanks for joining us.
1056420	1061760	Well same with this story and looking at the business side of things one industry that's already
1061760	1067680	feeling the impact of this conflict is the aviation industry with dozens of flights already
1067680	1072920	cancelled. Let's get the details with our business correspondent in Singapore, Ketty Silva.
1073240	1079100	Ketty what are we seeing? Well yeah as you mentioned many airlines cancelling flights the
1079100	1084400	likes for example of American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair all cancel
1084400	1089140	journeys. British Airways for its part told the BBC that it's only cancelled one flight
1089140	1094020	on Sunday and it's going to be adjusting departure times for flights in the coming days
1094020	1098340	and that's unclear if that's because of disruption at the airport or if perhaps they want
1098340	1103120	to land at different times of the day that may be deemed safer. Many of these airlines are
1103120	1109120	also offering passengers to to cancel their flights or to move the dates with no sort of change
1109120	1114780	fees. Flights to Israel's second international airport Iliad which is a tourist destination on
1114780	1119080	the Red Sea they've been unaffected but we've also heard that Israelis flag carrier El Al
1119080	1123700	it's said that it's going to be maintaining its flights to Tel Aviv for now but again allowing
1123700	1129560	airlines and passengers to change their flights. But Ketty this also comes at the same
1129560	1137060	time as many Israelis are trying or desperately trying to leave. Oh to leave as well as to get
1137060	1141600	home. So that's one of the major issues is that many have found themselves stranded and with fears
1141600	1147480	about whether or not the airspace will be closed. So one of our reporters for example
1147480	1152740	was actually there amongst them stranded in Cyprus, Atlantica International Airport late last night.
1153540	1157580	Hundreds were packing in hundreds of Israelis hoping to get one of the last flights home.
1158280	1163060	As I say rumors about whether or not the country may close its airspace. It was hard to get
1163060	1167540	tickets we understand. Dozens were waiting to get the seats for example for no shows on the fully
1167540	1172380	booked flights and getting back into the country certainly hasn't been easy. In terms of leaving
1172380	1176420	the country we've heard for example as well from Athens the foreign ministry is saying that
1176420	1182620	it's working to repatriate about 149 Greek tourists from Israel. Some of them were due to arrive
1182620	1188600	back late last night into Greece but there is indeed much concern about many of the the
1188600	1194120	workers in Israel. I know for example Thailand has about 30,000 workers in Israel and so governments
1194120	1198200	around the world looking at how they can get their citizens home if indeed they want to leave Israel.
1199060	1203120	All right Katie, it's always a pleasure to have you on the program our business correspondent
1203120	1208440	there in Singapore and we are remaining with this story and we are now going to speak to
1208440	1213960	our international editor Jeremy Bowen. Good morning to you Jeremy. Now you have called this
1213960	1218860	a major Middle East crisis. Can you elaborate that for us please if you may?
1219940	1228980	Well it's unprecedented that the Palestinian armed group Hamas has been able to break out of
1228980	1235320	Gaza which is surrounded by if you like a ring of steel of fences wire fences and concrete
1235830	1242720	break out and kill huge numbers of Israelis including many many civilians.
1243400	1251440	That kind of thing is something that Israel hasn't experienced before and it's becoming clear that
1251440	1257960	it's a national trauma and plenty of people here compare it to the 9-11 attacks in the United
1257960	1263380	States. There's even one article in one of the newspapers here saying that if you adjust the
1263380	1268320	death toll for population it's equivalent to the Americans losing more than 20,000
1268320	1276240	on 9-11. So it's a big big event and the Israeli response which is going to be
1276240	1282660	is already very heavy military action but they think there'll be a land invasion too of Gaza.
1283520	1289280	Now that also is something that could have reverberations right across the region so we're
1289280	1295840	into really unexplored territory right now. And Jeremy you have been in the region you have
1295840	1301260	been in the area just for our listeners benefit can you describe what Gaza Strip looks like
1301260	1303780	and how that area is to Israel?
1306700	1314060	Gaza is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast which is surrounded mostly
1314060	1323440	by Israel but with a narrow border which also goes into Egypt. The
1323440	1331500	the Palestinian population of Gaza is around 2.4 million people. Many of them are descendants of
1332080	1338680	families who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948, a time that the Palestinians
1338680	1345360	call the Nakba, the catastrophe. And it's an area where people are mostly very poor,
1345560	1351760	they live in very difficult and cramped conditions, they're mostly not allowed to leave the area.
1351760	1360470	There are plenty of adults there who've never left and so it's some it is a situation which is
1361080	1367280	life there is very hard and it's highly nationalistic and since 2007 it's been controlled
1367280	1373180	by the Palestinian militant group Hamas which is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic resistance
1373180	1379420	movement. And you wrote a nice read on our website where you said that you know Hamas
1379420	1385460	blindsided Israel with what you called most serious attack in a generation and we're hearing
1385460	1390040	stories of hostages that have been taken including civilians as well as soldiers.
1390660	1395360	What sort of challenge does this pose for the government of Mr Netanyahu and the army going
1395360	1401220	forward? It's the most profound challenge that any Israel government has I think faced
1401220	1405840	probably for 50 years since the 1973 Middle East war.
1407940	1414620	He is his political enemies are already blaming him saying that he took his eye off the ball for
1414620	1419880	a variety of reasons. It's clear that there's been from the Israeli perspective a huge
1419880	1425160	intelligence failure and they're struggling militarily to assert themselves they will
1425160	1430580	succeed in doing that. I'm pretty certain because Israel has got very powerful armed forces
1431220	1437900	I think the big question which was and this is that probably an equal challenge
1438480	1445500	for the Israelis is what happens after that how do they what happens in Gaza
1446100	1452800	on the day that they leave because the Israelis who used to occupy Gaza and finally pulled out in
1452800	1459720	2005 do not want to get back into a full-scale occupation but if they sent in their troops
1460560	1465560	there's going to have to be some kind of governance of a territory which is maybe
1465560	1470780	small but as I said contains getting on for two and a half million people.

1562220	1568460	Now we are going to turn to Afghanistan because thousands of people in the west of the country
1568460	1574240	are spending a second night in the open after a strong earthquake on Saturday reduced entire
1574240	1578920	villages to rubble. There's been confusion about the number of dead with Taliban officials
1578920	1585040	apologizing for an early assessment that more than 2,000 people had died. The United Nations
1585040	1591040	humanitarian agency says that more than 1,000 have been killed and more than 500 are still
1591040	1597220	missing. I'm now joined by my colleague from the Afghan service Angela Gehr. Good morning to
1597220	1601740	Angela. What is the latest that you can tell us about this devastating event?
1602940	1612180	Good morning. The news I'm receiving from Afghanistan is actually I can say
1612180	1623860	that is a very very very big the the the darkest time that we are experiencing in
1623860	1632300	Afghanistan. The number that the Taliban are trying to share with the media is very different
1632300	1640940	what we we have receiving from the people. I think in that area we have we had
1641540	1652300	more than 20 violence which are completely destroyed in the earthquake and also
1652740	1659180	there is no way for the actually in the first half where Taliban tried to control the medias
1659180	1667060	we didn't receive there actually we thought that everything is not that that bad what
1667580	1675900	what we we when when we we sent the volunteers group to to the area and and
1675900	1683360	actually I'm so sorry I'm no don't worry and so Angela basically the the the Taliban have gone
1683360	1688400	back to what they said the numbers have changed but what are people saying on the ground those
1688400	1697800	who've been affected they don't accept the numbers which the Taliban is sharing actually
1698140	1705980	and also I think more than 2 000 people are killed a thousand people displaced
1706620	1716360	and and thousand people are missed in missing in this crisis and we we have nothing at that
1716360	1725260	moment at this moment there are no no big big affair or support from from the Taliban for the
1725260	1735020	people just that just the Red Cross and MSF provided some help for the people and and
1735020	1740440	the volunteers group from Angela and other cities thank you so much for coming on to the program
